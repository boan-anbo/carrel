# This is the monorepo of Carrel eco-system

## Documentation

- The carrel system mainly uses four levels of documentation.
  1. Architectural level: a document that describes the overall design of the system and its parts, such as __this document__.
  2. Package level: each module has its own architectural documents, usually a README.md at the root of each folder.
  3. Module level: this is the internal documentation of a module, such as Rust's module documentation which can be generated or read directly at the module roots. This describes internally what a module does.
  4. Inline documentation: needless to say.
