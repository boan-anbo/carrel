SOME DETERMINING FACTORS IN MAZE-PERFORMANCE As a result of experiments on animal learning a great deal of attention has been paid to the establishment of the conditions which underlie efficient maze- performance. The conditions are complex and writers have tended to emphasize one condition or another without-so it seems to the present writer-gaining a satisfactory picture of the various interrelationships involved.' Among the factors which determine efficient maze-performance it is possible to distinguish at least three primary variables: 'knowledge,' 'reward,' and 'drive.' There is also a secondary variable, 'reward-value,'2 which is dependent upon all three of these. Let us then examine these variables and see how they are related to maze-performance and to each other. Knowledge is a requisite for efficient maze-performance. The rat must 'know' the maze if he is to traverse it rapidly and with a minimum of errors. And here we should note that the usual 'learning' experiment deals only with this relationship, measuring knowledge in terms of maze-performance. Blod- 'Professor Tolman has referred to the present analysis in a paper read at The Ninth International Congress of Psychology at New Haven, September 6, 1929. See E. C. Tolman, Maze-performance as a function of motivation and of reward as well as of knowledge of maze-paths, Proc. IX Internat. Cong. Psychol., 1929, 439f. 2The term 'reward-value' has been used with a slightly more limited meaning by Katherine A. Williams.
