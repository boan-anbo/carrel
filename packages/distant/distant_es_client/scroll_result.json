(In this \r\ngame the machine must not be excessively virtuous, as this might give it away.) According to \r\nthe ‘Turing triage test’, if a judge, forced to choose which of a human and a machine contestant \r\nto destroy, faces the same moral dilemma as if both were human, then the machine is a person. \r\nSome theorists even propose Turing’s game as a way of testing identity. If ater your ‘death’ we \r\nactivate a simulation of your brain in a computer, would that simulation be you? Ray Kurzweil, \r\na Google director of engineering who bet $20,000 that a machine would pass the Turing test \r\nby 2029, says: run a (two-player) imitation game—if the interrogator cannot tell the diference \r\nbetween talking to the simulation and talking to you, you are in the computer.\r\nhese games are mostly thought experiments. he best-known actual experiment is Hugh \r\nLoebner’s competition, which now ofers a silver medal (and $25,000 in 2016) to a machine \r\nfooling half the judges ater 25 minutes of questioning—and a yet-to-be-awarded grand prize \r\nand gold medal for the irst program to succeed in an imitation game in which the interrogator \r\ncommunicates with contestants via audio-visual inputs as well as text inputs. New competitions \r\nregularly appear; for example, in 2014 the XPRIZE Foundation, which designs and funds inno-\r\nvation competitions ‘aimed at capturing the imagination of the public, spurring innovation, \r\nand accelerating the rate of positive change across the globe’, announced the ‘A.I. XPRIZE’—a \r\n‘modern-day Turing test to be awarded to the irst A.I. to walk or roll out on stage and present \r\na TED talk so compelling that it commands a standing ovation’.21 Little serious money or sci-\r\nence has gone into developing machines to take part in such tests, however. (his is not limited \r\nto Turing-style AI competitions; in 2013 the British Computer Society’s Machine Intelligence \r\nCompetition for systems showing ‘progress towards machine intelligence’ was cancelled due to \r\n‘insuicient suitable entries’.22)\r\nIn actual experiments the winning ‘chatbots’ (computer programs that converse in natural \r\nlanguage) are simple programs. For example, in a 2012 test an interrogator typed ‘Epsom, home \r\nof the derby. yourself?’ to state her home town and ask the contestant to do likewise; the pro-\r\ngram Eugene Goostman responded with ‘My guinea pig says that name Derby sounds very nice’. \r\n(Simulating a Ukrainian 13-year-old is intended to explain away such odd and ungrammatical \r\noutputs.) his was the program announced as a ‘breakthrough’ in AI on the sixtieth anniversary \r\nof Turing’s death. Unsurprisingly, ater the initial hype surrounding Eugene Goostman, the \r\nmedia verdict was: if this program can pass Turing’s test then the test is ‘no longer as relevant as \r\nwe irst thought’. However, Eugene Goostman didn’t pass the test (see Chapter 25). he organ-\r\nizers set the threshold for passing as follows: ‘If a computer is mistaken for a human more than \r\n30% of the time during a series of 5-minute keyboard conversations it passes the test’.23 his \r\nconfuses Turing’s prediction of how far AI might come by roughly the turn of the century with \r\nthe rules of his game. He made the threshold clear: the interrogator must ‘decide wrongly as \r\noten [in the computer-imitates-human game] as he does when the game is played between a \r\nman and a woman’ (see the section ‘A little experiment’). In 1952 Turing said that this would \r\ntake at least 100 years.\r\nTuring-style tests are also used to test the believability of virtual characters and the photo-\r\nrealism of computer graphics. In one non-verbal test, a human subject interacts with a virtual \r\ncharacter and decides whether it is controlled by a human or a machine, based on how the ‘eyes’ \r\nmove in response to the subject’s gaze. In the ‘enriched’ Turing test, female subjects in a speed-\r\ndating experiment interacted twice with a virtual character; although they were told that the \r\n","uuid":"122994ea-9920-4317-8611-d5f273bbed9d"},"_type":"pdf","highlight":{"text":["292  |  27 THE TURING <em>TEST</em>— fROm EVERy ANGlE\r\nthe human, the machine has ‘musical intelligence’.","In the ‘moral’ Turing <em>test</em> an interrogator \r\ninterviews, or judges descriptions of the actions of, a","According to \r\nthe ‘Turing triage <em>test</em>’, if a judge, forced to choose which of a human and a machine","For example, in a 2012 <em>test</em> an interrogator typed ‘Epsom, home \r\nof the derby. yourself?’","then the <em>test</em> is ‘no longer as relevant as \r\nwe irst thought’."]}},{"_id":"yJmIMoIB__mz3Yx-kAF2","_index":"distant_rl_history","_score":26.388071,"_source":{"citeKey":"RNArtificial21","created":1616848843000,"fileName":"[R] [[RNArtificial21]] RussellS, NorvigP - 2021 - Artificial Intelligence - A Modern Approach, Global Edition.pdf","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[RNArtificial21]] RussellS, NorvigP - 2021 - Artificial Intelligence - A Modern Approach, Global Edition.pdf","modified":1656306034000,"pageIndex":20,"pages":1167,"text":"20 Chapter 1 Introduction\r\nfour. The methods used are necessarily different: the pursuit of human-like intelligence must\r\nbe in part an empirical science related to psychology, involving observations and hypotheses\r\nabout actual human behavior and thought processes; a rationalist approach, on the other hand,\r\ninvolves a combination of mathematics and engineering, and connects to statistics, control\r\ntheory, and economics. The various groups have both disparaged and helped each other. Let\r\nus look at the four approaches in more detail.\r\n1.1.1 Acting humanly: The Turing test approach\r\nThe Turing test, proposed by Alan Turing (1950), was designed as a thought experiment thatTuring test\r\nwould sidestep the philosophical vagueness of the question “Can a machine think?” A com-\r\nputer passes the test if a human interrogator, after posing some written questions, cannot tell\r\nwhether the written responses come from a person or from a computer. Chapter 28 discusses\r\nthe details of the test and whether a computer would really be intelligent if it passed. For\r\nnow, we note that programming a computer to pass a rigorously applied test provides plenty\r\nto work on. The computer would need the following capabilities:\r\n• natural language processing to communicate successfully in a human language;Natural language\r\nprocessing\r\n• knowledge representation to store what it knows or hears;Knowledge\r\nrepresentation\r\n• automated reasoning to answer questions and to draw new conclusions;Automated\r\nreasoning\r\n• machine learning to adapt to new circumstances and to detect and extrapolate patterns.\r\nMachine learning\r\nTuring viewed the physical simulation of a person as unnecessary to demonstrate intelligence.\r\nHowever, other researchers have proposed a total Turing test, which requires interaction withTotal Turing test\r\nobjects and people in the real world. To pass the total Turing test, a robot will need\r\n• computer vision and speech recognition to perceive the world;Computer vision\r\n• robotics to manipulate objects and move about.Robotics\r\nThese six disciplines compose most of AI. Yet AI researchers have devoted little effort to\r\npassing the Turing test, believing that it is more important to study the underlying princi-\r\nples of intelligence. The quest for “artificial flight” succeeded when engineers and inventors\r\nstopped imitating birds and started using wind tunnels and learning about aerodynamics.\r\nAeronautical engineering texts do not define the goal of their field as making “machines that\r\nfly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool even other pigeons.”\r\n1.1.2 Thinking humanly: The cognitive modeling approach\r\nTo say that a program thinks like a human, we must know how humans think. We can learn\r\nabout human thought in three ways:\r\n• introspection—trying to catch our own thoughts as they go by;Introspection\r\n• psychological experiments—observing a person in action;Psychological\r\nexperiment\r\n• brain imaging—observing the brain in action.Brain imaging\r\nOnce we have a sufficiently precise theory of the mind, it becomes possible to express the\r\ntheory as a computer program. If the program’s input–output behavior matches correspond-\r\ning human behavior, that is evidence that some of the program’s mechanisms could also be\r\noperating in humans.\r\nFor example, Allen Newell and Herbert Simon, who developed GPS, the “General Prob-\r\nlem Solver” (Newell and Simon, 1961), were not content merely to have their program solve\r\n","uuid":"f4abb2ed-51f0-4be7-a914-447e9fa1be37"},"_type":"pdf","highlight":{"text":["Let\r\nus look at the four approaches in more detail.\r\n1.1.1 Acting humanly: The Turing <em>test</em> approach","The Turing <em>test</em>, proposed by Alan Turing (1950), was designed as a thought experiment thatTuring <em>test</em>","A com-\r\nputer passes the <em>test</em> if a human interrogator, after posing some written questions, cannot tell","Chapter 28 discusses\r\nthe details of the <em>test</em> and whether a computer would really be intelligent if it","<em>test</em>\r\nobjects and people in the real world."]}},{"_id":"-5mLMoIB__mz3Yx-03zK","_index":"distant_rl_history","_score":26.388071,"_source":{"citeKey":"MDExploring16","created":1452531671000,"fileName":"[R] [[MDExploring16]] MyersD, DeWallC - 2016 - Exploring Psychology.pdf","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[MDExploring16]] MyersD, DeWallC - 2016 - Exploring Psychology.pdf","modified":1452704685000,"pageIndex":636,"pages":892,"text":"Beck’s Therapy for Depression\r\nCognitive therapist Aaron Beck believes that \r\nchanging people’s thinking can change their func-\r\ntioning. Depressed people, he found, often reported \r\ndreams with negative themes of loss, rejection, and \r\nabandonment. These thoughts extended into their \r\nwaking thoughts, and even into therapy, as clients \r\nrecalled and rehearsed their failings and worst \r\nimpulses (Kelly, 2000). With cognitive therapy, \r\nBeck and his colleagues (1979) sought to reverse \r\nclients’ negativity about themselves, their situa-\r\ntions, and their futures. With this technique, gentle \r\n questioning seeks to reveal irrational thinking, and \r\nthen to persuade people to remove the dark glasses \r\nthrough which they view life (Beck et al., 1979, pp. \r\n145–146): \r\nClient: I agree with the descriptions of me but I \r\nguess I don’t agree that the way I think makes me depressed.\r\nBeck: How do you understand it?\r\nClient: I get depressed when things go wrong. Like when I fail a test.\r\nBeck: How can failing a test make you depressed?\r\nClient: Well, if I fail I’ll never get into law school.\r\nBeck: So failing the test means a lot to you. But if failing a test could drive people \r\ninto clinical depression, wouldn’t you expect everyone who failed the test to \r\nhave a depression? . . . Did everyone who failed get depressed enough to require \r\n treatment?\r\nClient: No, but it depends on how important the test was to the person.\r\nBeck: Right, and who decides the importance?\r\nClient: I do.\r\nBeck: And so, what we have to examine is your way of viewing the test (or the way \r\nthat you think about the test) and how it affects your chances of getting into law \r\nschool. Do you agree?\r\nClient: Right.\r\nBeck: Do you agree that the way you interpret the results of the test will affect \r\nyou? You might feel depressed, you might have trouble sleeping, not feel like \r\n eating, and you might even wonder if you should drop out of the course.\r\nClient: I have been thinking that I wasn’t going to make it. Yes, I agree.\r\nBeck: Now what did failing mean?\r\nClient: (tearful) That I couldn’t get into law school.\r\nBeck: And what does that mean to you?\r\nClient: That I’m just not smart enough.\r\nBeck: Anything else?\r\nClient: That I can never be happy.\r\nBeck: And how do these thoughts make you feel?\r\nClient: Very unhappy.\r\nBeck: So it is the meaning of failing a test that makes you very unhappy. In fact, \r\nbelieving that you can never be happy is a powerful factor in producing \r\n unhappiness. So, you get yourself into a trap—by definition, failure to get \r\ninto law school equals “I can never be happy.”\r\nCognitive therapy for eating disor-\r\nders aided by journaling \r\nCognitive therapists guide people toward \r\nnew ways of explaining their good and \r\nbad experiences.

Thus test-\r\ning metamemory in animals requires looking for a relationship between two\r\ndifferent responses within the same situation: a report on memory strength\r\nand a direct test of memory. When accuracy on the direct test of memory is\r\nmanipulated, as by increasing the interval over which items must be remem-\r\nbered (the retention interval), the report on memory strength should change\r\naccordingly.\r\nOne way to encourage an animal to “report” its memory strength is to offer\r\na choice between taking a memory test and avoiding it. A large reward is\r\ngiven for correct responses on the memory test and no reward for getting\r\nit wrong; avoiding the test always earns a mediocre reward. Thus, animals\r\nthat can monitor their memory strength (i.e., that have metamemory) should\r\nchoose the memory test when they “know that they know” the answer and\r\notherwise accept the certain but mediocre reward. For instance, when the\r\nretention interval is lengthened, an animal with metamemory should avoid\r\nthe memory test more often, but on trials when it does choose to take the test\r\nit should perform better than when forced to take the test. Rhesus monkeys\r\nshow this pattern of relationships in several variations of such tasks. They also\r\ntransfer their metacognitive “reports” from one task to another (e.g., Kornell,\r\nSon, and Terrace 2007). And in one experiment (Hampton 2001) monkeys\r\nimmediately avoided memory tests on trials when nothing had been presented\r\nfor them to remember, more consistent with behavior based on an internal\r\nstate rather than external cues (Hampton 2009). In contrast, the repeated\r\nfailure of pigeons to pass this and other tests passed by monkeys (Sutton and\r\nShettleworth 2008) indicates that pigeons either have no metacognitive ability\r\nor do not readily use it. In that it is a kind of sensitivity to one’s own internal\r\nstate, metacognition is sometimes seen as a form of self-awareness. Since,\r\nas described next, some birds among the corvids show behavior consistent\r\nwith other conscious aspects of memory and self-awareness it would be of\r\ninterest to give them tests of metacognition. Mammals other than primates,\r\ntoo, remain to be given the range and depth of tests given to the monkeys.\r\nComparative research on metamemory provides an instructive contrast to\r\nthat on episodic memory, or conscious recollection of episodes in one’s per-\r\nsonal past. More so than research on metamemory, research on animal episodic\r\nmemory has been impelled by the promise of understanding its neural mecha-\r\nnisms in humans by studying “animal models.” This is because loss of episodic\r\nmemory is a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of amnesia. A\r\nlandmark here was the demonstration by Clayton and Dickinson (1998) that\r\nWestern scrub jays, a food-storing corvid, remember what items they cached\r\nin which locations at a particular time in the past.

We also made\r\nsome comparisons with both precomputed and recomputed descriptions.\r\nWhen descriptions are precomputed, the computing effort is less with\r\nthe full similarity test then without it; the factor of saving ranged from 10\r\nto 60 per cent (e.g., 3534/5206 for theorem 2.08). However, if LT must\r\nrecompute the descriptions every time, the full similarity test is actually\r\nmore expensive than no similarity test at all (e.g., 26,739/22,914 for\r\ntheorem 2.45).\r\nThe modified similarity test fares somewhat better.

Section 4.7, however, shows that for this\r\n sequential test the expected values Eo(n) and Ei(n) are very nearly imized.8\r\n Thus, for practical purposes this test can be considered an optimum test.\r\n 3.2. Fundamental relations among the quantities a, A, A and B. In this section\r\n the quantities a, ,, A and B will be related by certain inequalities which are of\r\n basic importance for the sequential analysis.\r\n Let {Xmn} (m = 1, 2, * * *, ad inf.) be an infinite sequence of observations. The\r\n set of all possible infinite sequences {x\"n} is called the infinite dimensional sample\r\n space. It will be denoted by M.. Any particular infinite sequence {x\"} is\r\n called a point of M . For any set of n given real numbers al, * * * , a.n we shall\r\n denote by C(ai, -.. , a.) the subset of M which consists of all points (infinite\r\n sequences) {xm} (m = 1, 2, - * *, ad inf.) for which xi = al, * - *, xn = an . For\r\n any values al, . . , a. the set C(ai, * * , a\") will be called a cylindric point of\r\n order n. A subset S of M will be called a cylindric point, if there exists a posi-\r\n tive integer n for which S is a cylindric point of order n. Thus, a cylindric point\r\n may be a cylindric point of order 1, or of order 2, etc. A cylindric point C(ai,\r\n I an) will be said to be of type 1 if\r\n pin _ f1(a1)f1(a2) ... fi(an) > A\r\n pon fo(a,)fo(a2) ... fo(an)\r\n * It seems likely to the author that Eo(n) and El(n) are exactly minimized for the se-\r\n quential probability ratio test. However, he did not succeed in proving it, except for a\r\n special class of problems (see section 4.7).\r\nThis content downloaded from \r\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000128.36.7.77 on Wed, 13 Apr 2022 13:21:42 UTC\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \r\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\r\n","uuid":"926c261d-9f53-4631-b9ff-2553ce7d4141"},"_type":"pdf","highlight":{"text":["POm\r\n Thus, the number n of observations required by the <em>test</em> is the smallest integral\r\n value of m for","The constants A and B are\r\n chosen so that 0 < B < A and the sequential <em>test</em> has the desired value a","We shall call the <em>test</em> procedure defined by (3.8),\r\n (3.9) and (3.10), a sequential probability ratio","<em>test</em>.","nearly imized.8\r\n Thus, for practical purposes this <em>test</em> can be considered an optimum <em>test</em>.\r\n 3.2."]}},{"_id":"eZiHMoIB__mz3Yx-jdr_","_index":"distant_rl_history","_score":26.386648,"_source":{"citeKey":"KWWAlgorithms22","created":1621604920000,"fileName":"[R] [[KWWAlgorithms22]] KochenderferM et al - 2022 - Algorithms for Decision Making.pdf","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[KWWAlgorithms22]] KochenderferM et al - 2022 - Algorithms for Decision Making.pdf","modified":1621604920000,"pageIndex":437,"pages":690,"text":"416 chapter 20. exact belief state planning\r\nSolution: Recall that there are |A|(|O|h−1)/(|O|−1) possible h-step plans.

Let So be any sequential probability ratio test for deciding\r\n between two simple alternatives Ho and H1, and Si another test for the same\r\n purpose. We define (i, j = 0, 1):\r\n a*(Sj) = probability, under Si, of rejecting Hi when it is true;\r\n E' (n) = expected number of observations to reach a decision under test Si\r\n when the hypothesis Hi is true. (It is assumed that EM (n) exists.)\r\n In this paper it is proved that, if\r\n ai (Si) < aei(So) (i = 0,1),\r\n it follows that\r\n E? (n) < E (n) (i =l 01).\r\n This means that of all tests with the same power the sequential probability ratio\r\n test requires on the average fewest observations. This result had been con-\r\n jectured earlier ([1], [21).\r\n 2. Introduction. Let pi(x), i = 0, 1, denote two different probability density\r\n functions or (discrete) probability functions. (Throughout this paper the index\r\n i will always take the values 0, 1). Let X be a chance variable whose distribu-\r\n tion can only be either po(x) or p1(x), but is otherwise unknown.

(Occasionally, PARRY’s linguistic\r\nlimitations led to a diagnosis of physical brain damage.) And the man or machine?\r\nguesses of the third group achieved only chance level.\r\nColby himself had the wit to see that this wasn’t a Turing Test as the master had\r\ndefined it. He pointed out that, had the interviewers been warned, they would have asked\r\ndifferent questions, designed to discover whether the interviewee was a program. In a\r\nfollow-up experiment, he did warn the judges beforehand—and they were mistaken\r\nalmost as often (Heiser et al. 1980). Again, however, this wasn’t the unrestricted\r\ntest imagined by Turing: the psychiatrists’ freedom to question was limited by medical\r\nethics (one communicant was a human patient) and professional focusing (on paranoia,\r\nand its simulation). And again, Colby was explicit about this, referring to ‘‘Turing-\r\nLike Tests’’ and stressing the limitations of such experiments in assessing simulations.\r\nSimilarly, John Clippinger (1977, ch. 9) pointed out that the plausibility tests done on\r\nERMA weren’t reliable as validations of his psychological theory (Chapter 7.ii.c). Other\r\ncommentators were often less careful, describing the programs in these (and similar)\r\nexamples as having passed the Turing Test.\r\nThe high media profile given to this type of case not only brought the Turing Test into\r\nthe layman’s vocabulary, but also reinforced its presence in the vocabulary of AI. The\r\nearly AI researchers had been inspired by the scientific vision of Turing’s 1950 paper,\r\nand its many challenges to their ingenuity. In addition, most had read it as providing\r\na criterion of their success. Especially in the 1960s and early 1970s, AI work was often\r\njudged in terms of some version of the Turing Test. Colby’s experimental ‘‘validation’’\r\nwas a case in point. And most philosophers agreed that the Test was an appropriate\r\ncriterion. Hubert Dreyfus, for instance, declared it to be ‘‘just what was needed’’ for\r\nevaluating AI (H. L. Dreyfus 1972, p. xxi).\r\nToday, outsiders still use TT comparisons to evaluate AI’s achievements—usually,\r\nto criticize them. By 1980 however, serious AI professionals were much less likely to\r\njudge their work in these terms. Bernard Meltzer, first Editor of the journal Artificial\r\nIntelligence, had already argued that the Turing Test was not only irrelevant but\r\nconstraining, since it limited AI to considering human intelligence (Meltzer 1971).\r\nFrom 1980 onwards, AI researchers in general came to agree with him.\r\nJohn McCarthy, in a presidential pep talk to his fellow AAAI members, specifically said\r\nthat improving standards in AI research did not require passing, or even considering,\r\nthe Turing Test: it was a ‘‘challenge’’, not a ‘‘scientific criterion’’ (1984: 8; see 11.iii.b).\r\nA few years later, when AI was no longer in its infancy and so-called ‘‘failures’’ had\r\nmultiplied, several writers described evaluation by Turing Test as positively damaging to\r\nAI (Hayes and Ford 1995; Whitby 1996a; Sloman 2002).

The test requires a program\r\nto have a conversation (via typed messages) with an interrogator for five minutes. The in-\r\nterrogator then has to guess if the conversation is with a program or a person; the program\r\npasses the test if it fools the interrogator 30% of the time. To Turing, the key point was not\r\nthe exact details of the test, but instead the idea of measuring intelligence by performance on\r\nsome kind of open-ended behavioral task, rather than by philosophical speculation.\r\nNevertheless, Turing conjectured that by the year 2000 a computer with a storage of a\r\nbillion units could pass the test, but here we are on the other side of 2000, and we still can’t\r\nagree whether any program has passed. Many people have been fooled when they didn’t know\r\nthey might be chatting with a computer. The ELIZA program and Internet chatbots such as\r\nMGONZ (Humphrys, 2008) and NATACHATA (Jonathan et al., 2009) fool their correspondents\r\nrepeatedly, and the chatbot CYBERLOVER has attracted the attention of law enforcement be-\r\ncause of its penchant for tricking fellow chatters into divulging enough personal information\r\nthat their identity can be stolen.\r\nIn 2014, a chatbot called Eugene Goostman fooled 33% of the untrained amateur judges\r\nin a Turing test. The program claimed to be a boy from Ukraine with limited command of\r\nEnglish; this helped explain its grammatical errors. Perhaps the Turing test is really a test of\r\nhuman gullibility. So far no well-trained judge has been fooled (Aaronson, 2014).\r\nTuring test competitions have led to better chatbots, but have not been a focus of research\r\nwithin the AI community. Instead, AI researchers who crave competition are more likely\r\nto concentrate on playing chess or Go or StarCraft II, or taking an 8th grade science exam,\r\nor identifying objects in images. In many of these competitions, programs have reached\r\nor surpassed human-level performance, but that doesn’t mean the programs are human-like\r\noutside the specific task. The point is to improve basic science and technology and to provide\r\nuseful tools, not to fool judges.\r\n28.2 Can Machines Really Think?\r\nSome philosophers claim that a machine that acts intelligently would not be actually thinking,\r\nbut would be only a simulation of thinking. But most AI researchers are not concerned with\r\nthe distinction, and the computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra (1984) said that “The question of\r\nwhether Machines Can Think . . . is about as relevant as the question of whether Submarines\r\nCan Swim.” The American Heritage Dictionary’s first definition of swim is “To move through\r\nwater by means of the limbs, fins, or tail,” and most people agree that submarines, being\r\nlimbless, cannot swim. The dictionary also defines fly as “To move through the air by means\r\nof wings or winglike parts,” and most people agree that airplanes, having winglike parts,\r\ncan fly. However, neither the questions nor the answers have any relevance to the design or\r\ncapabilities of airplanes and submarines; rather they are about word usage in English.

S T E R N B E R G  \r\nI viewed myself as eminently superior to the younger kids, who I per- \r\nceived as little more than infants. Certainly I could compete with fifth \r\ngraders! So I took the test without anxiety, and the test anxiety disap- \r\npeared and never returned. \r\nWhat did not disappear, however, was a life-long interest in the \r\nnature, measurement, and development of intelligence. This interest \r\nwas rather strange for a young child, and it was not a whole lot less \r\nstrange among the cognitive psychologists with whom I was trained in \r\ngraduate school and with whom I would later associate as a professor. \r\nThe interest started early: Even in elementary school, every year I would \r\nwrite a workbook with exercises that I thought would help children in \r\nthe grade I was in to develop their intelligence. But I was interested not \r\nonly in developing intelligence-I wanted to test it. \r\nIn seventh grade, at age 13, I wanted to understand intelligence, \r\nand implicitly, why I had done so poorly on the tests. Test anxiety was \r\na concept with which I was not yet familiar; but stupidity was something \r\nI was quite familiar with, and I wondered whether I was afflicted with \r\nit. So when we were asked to come up with ideas for science projects, \r\nI generated an idea that almost certainly had not been tried by others \r\nin Mr. Adams’s seventh-grade science class. I proposed to do a project \r\non the development of mental testing. As part of the project, I invented \r\nmy own test, the Sternberg Test of Mental Abilities which, like my work- \r\nbooks (and my childhood comic books), is long since lost. In visiting, \r\nfor the first time, the adult section of the Maplewood, New Jersey, town \r\nlibrary, I discovered the book Measuring Intelligence (Terman 8- Merrill, \r\n1937), which contained the verbal materials for the Stanford-Binet In- \r\ntelligence Scales (2nd ed.). I thought it would be a good idea to get \r\nsome practice in administering the tests to some classmates. \r\nThe first classmate to whom I gave the test was a girl in whom I \r\nwas romantically interested. I was rather shy and thought that perhaps \r\ngiving her the IQ test would help break the ice. I was wrong. She did \r\nvery well on the test, but the romantic relationship never got started. \r\nThe second classmate to whom I gave the test was one I had known \r\nfrom the Cub Scouts. Another disaster. He told his mother, who told the \r\njunior high school guidance counselor, who told a school psychologist. \r\nI was called away from a social studies class one day, balled out for 40 \r\nminutes, and informed by the psychologist that if I ever brought the \r\nbook into school again, he personally would burn it. He suggested that \r\nif I had to study intelligence, I study it instead in rats. I don’t think he \r\nwas offering himself as a subject. \r\nAt this point, I learned a lesson about defying the crowd, a lesson I \r\nrelearn on a regular basis: Defying the crowd has costs, sometimes steep \r\nones. It almost always is easier to follow the crowd and join in the fads \r\n(Sternberg, 1997a).

The main claim is\r\nthat the physical level and the cognitive level of intelligence are inseparable. The\r\nsubcognitive questions reveal information about the low-level cognitive processes\r\nof the entities answering them. In a way, if used during the TT, these would allow\r\nthe interrogator to ‘peek behind the screen’ (French, 1990, p. 62). These questions\r\nallow comparison of the associative concept networks of the two candidates. And\r\nbecause these networks are formed after a lifetime of experiencing the world and\r\nthe structure and nature of them are necessarily dependent on physical aspects of\r\nthat experience (like human sense organs, their locations in the body, etc.), the\r\ncomputer will be distinguishable from the human. In short, it is not possible for a\r\ncomputer (or any other non-human) to be successful in playing the IG. Not having\r\nexperienced the world as we have is not just an obstacle, but a severe restriction in\r\nthis task. This is due to the fact that the TT is a test for human intelligence, just as\r\nthe Seagull Test is a test for Nordic seagull flight.\r\nFrench considers whether there can be a modification of the TT that does not\r\nreduce the computers’ chances of passing it to zero. He explains the impossibility\r\nof this as follows:\r\nSurely, we would not want to limit a Turing Test to questions like \"What is the\r\ncapital of France?\" or \"How many sides does a triangle have?\". If we admit that\r\nintelligence in general must have something to do with categorization, analogy-\r\nmaking, and so on, we will of course want to ask questions that test these\r\ncapacities. But these are the very questions that will allow us, unfailingly, to\r\nunmask the computer (French, 1990, p. 63).\r\nFrench repeatedly states, as was mentioned above, that the TT is a test for\r\nhuman intelligence. It may seem that by proposing subcognitive questions he is\r\nstipulating that a human subcognitive substrate is necessary for intelligence in\r\ngeneral, but this is only apparent. What Frenchreally attempts to demonstrate, as he\r\nexplains, is that the human subcognitive substrate is necessary to pass the TT (as\r\nthe subcognitive questions show), and that the TT is inadequate precisely because\r\nof this. He holds that this substrate is definitely not necessary for intelligence in\r\ngeneral, just as being a Nordic seagull is not a necessary condition for flight.\r\nFrench’s paper is significant in another sense: Instead of discussing whether\r\npassing the TT is a sufficient or necessary condition for machine thought, he asks\r\nwhether the test can be passed at all. Let Searle have his room and Block his Aunt\r\nBubbles. French reminds us that the TT is difficult when you leave your armchair.\r\nA criticism of French’s ‘Subcognition and the Limits of the Turing Test’ (French,\r\n1990), has been made by Dale Jacquette in Jacquette (1993b). For French’s re-\r\nsponse to Jacquette, the reader should refer to French (1995).\r\n","uuid":"5f246f22-cdd2-424b-a9f4-315759d8433b"},"_type":"pdf","highlight":{"fileName":["[R] [[PCATuring00]] Pinar SayginA et al - 2000 - Turing <em>Test</em> - 50 Years Later.pdf"],"filePath":["D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[PCATuring00]] Pinar SayginA et al - 2000 - Turing <em>Test</em> - 50 Years"],"text":["TURING <em>TEST</em>: 50 YEARS LATER 495\r\nquestions are highly dependent on our having experienced life as a human","studied French’s subcognitive questions, let us see how he\r\nuses these to refute the TT as a useful <em>test</em>","This is due to the fact that the TT is a <em>test</em> for human intelligence, just as\r\nthe Seagull <em>Test</em> is a","<em>test</em> for Nordic seagull flight.","French repeatedly states, as was mentioned above, that the TT is a <em>test</em> for\r\nhuman intelligence."]}},{"_id":"LZiIMoIB__mz3Yx-P_Vz","_index":"distant_rl_history","_score":26.22142,"_source":{"citeKey":"YYArmy20","created":null,"fileName":"[R] [[YYArmy20]] YoakumC, YerkesR - 1920 - Army Mental Tests.pdf","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[YYArmy20]] YoakumC, YerkesR - 1920 - Army Mental Tests.pdf","modified":null,"pageIndex":329,"pages":341,"text":"INDEX 297\r\nCoöperation, value of, 203–204\r\nCorrelation, intelligence and industrial efficiency, 201–202\r\nwith military value, 30-33\r\nof alpha with school data, 189\r\nof beta with school data, 190\r\nCorrelations, 20\r\nCrime and intelligence, 194–195\r\nCriteria, for army tests, 2\r\nCube analysis test, 83\r\nconstruction test, 105, 121\r\nimitation test, 104, 121\r\nCubes, demonstration for beta, 79\r\nD\r\nDartmouth College, intelligence measurements in, 165\r\nDearborn, form board, 107, 122\r\nDemonstration figures, beta, 284\r\nDemonstrator, in beta, 80–81\r\nDepartments of University, results for, 171\r\nDesigns, 110, 122\r\nfigures for, 143–152\r\nDevelopment battalion, and intelligence, 95\r\nDigit-symbol test, 85, 112 , 122, 290\r\nDirections, for alpha examination , 53–66\r\nfor army examining, 41\r\nfor beta examination, 79-88\r\nfor individual examination, 92\r\nfor scoring alpha, 66\r\nfor scoring beta, 88\r\nDisarranged sentences test, 64, 158\r\nDodge, Lieut.-Commander Raymond, on coöperation, 203–204\r\non mental engineering, 184-188\r\nE\r\nEducation, of soldier, 194\r\nEducational applications of mental tests, 188–193\r\ninstitutions, intelligence measurements for, 163\r\nEngineering, mental, 184–188\r\nEquipment, for army examining, 135–136\r\nfor special building, 137–142\r\nEquivalent scores and letter grades, 134\r\ntable of, 133, 134\r\nExamination, conduct of, 52\r\nfor S.

LTD is-associative and can be induced in a test input \r\nwhen interacting with a stronger conditioning input on the same dendritic tree, but \r\nonly if the two inputs are negatively correlated in time. The stimulus paradigm that \r\nwas used, illustrated in Figure 7.IB, was based on the finding that high-frequency \r\nbursts of stimuli spaced 200 ms apart are optimal in eliciting LTP (Larson & Lynch, \r\n1986). The conditioning, or strong stimulus pattern, which was almost always \r\neffective in eliciting maximal LTP, consisted of trains of 10 bursts of 5 pulses each \r\nat a frequency of 100 Hz, with a 200 ms interburst intervaL Each train lasted 2 \r\nseconds and had a total of 50 stimuli. The test, or weak stimuli, a train of single \r\nshocks at 5 Hz frequency, were given either superimposed on the middle of each \r\nburst (positively correlated, or 'in phase1), or symmetrically between the bursts \r\n(negatively correlated, or *out  of phase*).\r\nThe strong stimulus was applied to the Schaffer collaterals and the test \r\nstimulus was applied to the subicular input on the opposite side of the recording \r\nsite, as shown in Figure 7.1A.

The conditioning site was then stimulated \r\nalone, which elicited homosynaptic LTP of this pathway but did not significantly \r\nalter the amplitude of responses to the test input. When the test and conditioning \r\ninputs were activated in phase, the test input synapses were associatively \r\npotentiated, as predicted (Figure 7.2A). In contrast, when test and conditioning \r\ninputs were applied out of phase, an associative depression of the test input \r\nsynapses was induced that lasted for hours (Figure 7.2B). The duration of \r\nassociative LTD was at least 30 minutes (Figure 7.2C) and up to 3 hours following \r\nstimulation. The amplitude and duration of associative LTD or LTP could be \r\nincreased by stimulating input pathways with more trains of shocks. When weak \r\ninput shocks were applied both superimposed and between the bursts, so that the \r\naverage covariance was zero between test and conditioning inputs, there was no net \r\nchange in synaptic strength.

Some people might devote nearly every remark\r\n to complaints about the unpleasantness of these interminable\r\n Turing Tests. If one sets one's sights on making a machine that\r\n does only as well in the Turing Test as most people would do,\r\n one might try a hybrid machine, containing a relatively small\r\n number of trees plus a bag of tricks of the sort used in Weizen-\r\n baum's program.\r\n Perhaps many tricks can be found to reduce the memory load\r\n without making the machine any smarter. Of course, no matter\r\n how sophisticated the memory-reduction tricks we find, they\r\n merely postpone, but do not avoid the inevitable combinatorial\r\n explosion. For the whole point of the machine is to substitute\r\n memory for intelligence. So for a Turing Test of some length,\r\n perhaps a machine of the general type that I have described\r\n will be so large that making it any larger will cause collapse\r\n into a black hole. My point is that technical ingenuity being\r\n what it is, the point at which nomological impossibility sets\r\n in may be beyond what is required to simulate human conversa-\r\n tional abilities.\r\n Objection 7. The fault of the Turing Test as you describe it is one\r\n of experimental design, not experimental concept. The trouble\r\n is that your Turing Test has a fixed length. The programmers\r\n must know the length in order to program the machine. In an\r\n adequate version of the Turing Test, the duration of any occasion\r\n of testing would be decided in some random manner. In short,\r\n the trouble with your criticism is that you've set up a straw man.\r\n Reply. It is certainly true that my machine's capacity to pass\r\n Turing Tests depends on there being some upper bound to the\r\n length of the tests. But the same is true of people. Even if we\r\n allow, say, twelve hours between question and answer to give\r\n people time to eat and sleep, still, people eventually die.

Apparently, they can hardly avoid\r\ninferring a conclusion from what they see, apart from rejecting unsupported\r\nguesses. Science is no different. In the significance test procedure, efforts\r\nhave been made to guarantee the Popperian line of thinking. However, in\r\nfollowing this line, we end up by rejecting a hypothesis nobody has ever\r\nactually committed themselves to, and with a persuasive suggestion that we\r\ncan trust the alternative hypothesis. This “unPopperian” result of the pro-\r\ncedure, however, is precisely what makes it meaningful. From a psychological\r\npoint of view, no scientist is interested in all these rejected null hypotheses,\r\nor memorizes them as the “state of knowledge in the field”, even if, from a\r\nlogical point of view, this huge collection of rejected hypotheses is all there\r\nis. Clearly, not only do human hypothesis testers and real scientists tend to\r\nmake inductions to eventually confirm a hypothesis, but even falsificationism\r\ncannot do without it. Even more, as I will argue hereafter: falsificationism’s\r\nbenefits can only be argued for with reference to its inductive benefits. Falsifi-\r\ncationism is good because it leads to the best inductive verifications, and\r\nprecisely not to the best falsifications.\r\nThe relation between Popper’s falsificationism on the one side, and induc-\r\ntive verification on the other, can be elucidated by analyzing the respective\r\nmeasures developed by Popper. These measures are “severity of test”, being\r\na measure for the falsifying potential of a piece of evidence, and “degree of\r\ncorroboration”, which is the value of a piece of evidence to “corroborate” a\r\nhypothesis (Popper, 1963/1974). “Severity of test” is the value of a piece of\r\nevidence representing one of the possible results from a test, and supporting\r\nthe hypothesis tested. For example, the hypothesis H can be tested with a\r\ntest with possible outcomes e and f, whereby observation e supports H and\r\nobservation f falsifies H. As the evidence e deviates more from what is\r\nexpected under background knowledge, it represents a more severe test for\r\nhypothesis H. The three parameters of the definition of test severity are: H,\r\nthe hypothesis, e, the piece of evidence, and b, the background knowledge.\r\nThe severity function is called S:\r\nS(e,H,b) =\r\np(e|H and b)\r\np (e|b)\r\n(1)\r\nThe second measure is the “degree of corroboration” of a hypothesis.

THE REWARD-VALUE OF INDIFFERENT STIMULATION 187 \r\nA. Experiment 1: No Light Change during Test Trials \r\nThree groups of 22 rats went through 15-minute sessions in a Skin­\r\nner box on each of 14 consecutive days. Days 2, 6, and 14 were Test \r\ndays, and the remaining days were Training days. \r\nThe test chamber was illuminated by light coming through frosted \r\nglass from a port in the ceiling. For most of the time, the luminance of \r\nthe port was 1 mL, but a light change consisted of a rise from 1 mL to 2 \r\nmL with a return to 1 mL after 1 second. \r\nOn Test days, no light changes occurred for any of the animals when \r\nthe bar was pressed. On Training days, however, the treatment varied \r\nfrom group to group. The experimental (E) group received a light \r\nchange every time the bar was pressed. Each member of the yoked-\r\ncontrol (YC) group received a light change whenever its Ε partner in \r\nthe adjacent box pressed the bar. No light changes were experienced \r\nby the control (NLG) group. \r\nBy having test sessions during which animals of all groups were \r\ntreated alike and separating each test session from the last training \r\nsession by one day, we were able to ascertain whether the occurrence \r\nof a light change as a consequence of bar-pressing would produce a \r\nlearned strengthening of the bar-pressing response. Differences in \r\nreward-value could be distinguished from performance effects, in-\r\ntrained under different conditions, a test under identical conditions at \r\nleast 24 hours after the last training trial. \r\nTwo groups of experimenters have done this with light onset. For-\r\ngays and Levin (1958) gave their rats seven daily extinction trials after \r\n14 daily training trials and verified that there was more bar-pressing \r\nduring extinction in the experimental group that had had light \r\nchanges during training than in the control group that had not. A de­\r\nlayed test in extinction conditions was also given by Crowder, Morris, \r\nDyer, and Robinson (1961), who obtained differences of only border­\r\nline significance. \r\nIn the case of light onset, we can regard the experiment by Forgays \r\nand Levin as a satisfactory enough demonstration of reward-value. But \r\nnobody had provided a comparable demonstration for the reputed \r\nreward-value of light increment, and, for the reasons mentioned \r\nabove, this seemed worth attempting. The first experiment in the se­\r\nries (Berlyne, Salapatek, Gelman, & Zener, 1964) set out to ascertain, \r\nwith all necessary controls, whether light increment can reinforce an \r\ninstrumental response in the rat. \r\n","uuid":"4b83c0a9-e62d-4446-aebf-f78c59498edf"},"_type":"pdf","highlight":{"text":["Experiment 1: No Light Change during <em>Test</em> Trials \r\nThree groups of 22 rats went through 15-minute sessions","Days 2, 6, and 14 were <em>Test</em> \r\ndays, and the remaining days were Training days.","The <em>test</em> chamber was illuminated by light coming through frosted \r\nglass from a port in the ceiling.","On <em>Test</em> days, no light changes occurred for any of the animals when \r\nthe bar was pressed.","By having <em>test</em> sessions during which animals of all groups were \r\ntreated alike and separating each <em>test</em>"]}},{"_id":"wJqRMoIB__mz3Yx-S1eo","_index":"distant_rl_history","_score":26.185692,"_source":{"citeKey":"WalSequential45","created":1470492231000,"fileName":"[R] [[WalSequential45]] WaldA - 1945 - Sequential Tests of Statistical Hypotheses.pdf","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[WalSequential45]] WaldA - 1945 - Sequential Tests of Statistical Hypotheses.pdf","modified":1599779636000,"pageIndex":41,"pages":71,"text":" SEQUENTIAL TESTS 157\r\n and\r\n EI(n I S) El(z) E1 (og P s)\r\n (= E-(z) [E (log Pn S )+ (1 - 3)E** (log pn S)].\r\n From equations (4.71)-(4.74) and Lemma 1 we obtain the inequalities\r\n (4.84) E* (log-|i S) < log 1- a\r\n (4.85) E** (log pnS) < log1\r\n (4.86) E' (log P oS) = -E* (log pn S) < log 1 a\r\n and\r\n (4.87) Ec* (log p S) = -E *(log pnS) < log 1-C\r\n Since Eo(z) < 0, (4.80) follows from (4.82), (4.84) and (4.85).

It evaluates the effect of\r\nan intervening or new learned act upon the retention of an old one.\r\nFor the purposes of the study of forgetting, the retroaction design would\r\nseem to be the appropriate one, since it is concerned with retention.\r\nIn the retroaction design the condition which produces the negative\r\ntransfer occurs in between original learning and a test for retention.

Without such an explicit illustration it might \r\nnot have been immediately obvious how these circles within circles \r\ncould yield hierarchical trees.\r\nMore complicated Plans—Woodworth refers to them as “poly­\r\nphase motor units”—can be similarly described as TOTE units built \r\nup of subplans that are themselves TOTE units. A bird will take off, \r\nmake a few wing strokes, glide, brake with its wings, thrust its feet \r\nforward, and land on the limb. The whole action is initiated as a unit, \r\nis controlled by a single Plan, yet is composed of several phases, each \r\ninvolving its own Plan, which may in turn be comprised of subplans, \r\netc.\r\nNote that it is the operational phase of the TOTE that is ex­\r\npanded into a list of other TOTE units. If we wish to preserve the \r\nTOTE pattern as it is diagrammed in Figure 1, we cannot use it to \r\nbuild up more complicated tests.\" The tests that are available, there­\r\nfore, are conceived to be relatively fixed; it is the operational phase \r\nthat may be quite various and complex. The operational phase may, \r\nof course, consist of a list of TOTEs, or it may terminate in efferent \r\nactivity.12 If we consider complex Plans—TOTE hierarchies in which \r\nthe operation of one TOTE is itself a list of TOTE units—then some \r\ngeneral properties of such systems become apparent:\r\n11 The reason that the TOTE of Figure 1 can be expanded only in its opera­\r\ntional phase is purely formal and can be appreciated by simple counting: There \r\nare four arrows associated with Test; there are two arrows associated with Oper­\r\nate; and there are two arrows associated with TOTE as a unit. Therefore, if the \r\ntwo-arrowed TOTE is used to construct some component of another TOTE, the \r\ncomponent it constructs must be the two-arrowed Operate, not the four-arrowed \r\nTest. However, rigid restrictions such as these are probably unrealistic and justi­\r\nfiable only in terms of pedagogic simplification. Anyone who has studied the \r\nhierarchically organized programs written by Newell, Shaw, and Simon to simu­\r\nlate human problem-solving will recognize how primitive and unelaborated these \r\nTOTE hierarchies really are.\r\n12 If we take seriously the suggested form of the TOTE, the system may be \r\neasily trapped into loops. For example, if the subtests in the expansion of an \r\noperational phase all pass, but the basic test fails, a loop will exist. In order to \r\navoid loops we might insist that the basic test imply the disjunction of the sub­\r\ntests. A more realistic solution would accept the occurrence of loops as a signal \r\nthat the Plan was not successful in producing the result for which the basic test \r\nwas designed; it would then be necessary to provide further machinery for dis­\r\ncovering and stopping such loops.\r\nThe Unit of Analysis ■ 37\r\n","uuid":"683fd801-c7de-480d-8d1c-386b8135c473"},"_type":"pdf","highlight":{"text":["It is merely an illustration of how several \r\nsimple TOTE units, each with its own <em>test</em>-operate-<em>test</em>","loop, can be \r\nembedded in the operational phase of a larger unit with its particular \r\n<em>test</em>-operate-<em>test</em>","is purely formal and can be appreciated by simple counting: There \r\nare four arrows associated with <em>Test</em>","For example, if the subtests in the expansion of an \r\noperational phase all pass, but the basic <em>test</em>","In order to \r\navoid loops we might insist that the basic <em>test</em> imply the disjunction of the sub­\r\ntests"]}},{"_id":"NpqPMoIB__mz3Yx-2SDN","_index":"distant_rl_history","_score":26.032267,"_source":{"citeKey":"ManPsychology04","created":1117115218000,"fileName":"[R] [[ManPsychology04]] ManktelowK - 2004 - Psychology of Reasoning - Theoretical and Historical Perspectives.pdf","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[ManPsychology04]] ManktelowK - 2004 - Psychology of Reasoning - Theoretical and Historical Perspectives.pdf","modified":1658012496000,"pageIndex":350,"pages":393,"text":"result in actual falsifications. Thus, the benefits of falsificationist testing are\r\nexemplified not by cases that result in the pursued and expected falsification,\r\nbut by those cases in which the actual falsification failed and the test resulted\r\nin a confirmation. But, on the basis of the very strategy of falsificationism,\r\nnamely looking for the falsifications, it follows that for every case producing a\r\nconfirmation, probably hundreds of cases ending up with such a falsification\r\nmust have taken place in anonymity.\r\nThe second reason why the “selection bias” in the choice of examples of\r\ngood falsificationsim is important is that falsifying testing borrows its very\r\nmerits from the confirming result, as was already argued in the formal analy-\r\nsis. The superiority of a testing strategy aimed at falsifying the hypothesis lies\r\nin the failure of this attempt, and the high degree of corroboration of the\r\nactual confirming test result. The high probative value of the confirming\r\nevidence arising from a falsificatory test is a direct consequence of looking for\r\nfalsification. This is reflected by our intuition about the significance of the\r\nMichelson–Morley experiment. By contrast, keeping silent about falsifying\r\ntest cases that resulted in the expected falsification is striking because these\r\ncases can be shown to be particularly insignificant. Indeed, in these cases the\r\nbrave falsificationist tester is left behind with an observation that is at odds\r\nwith his or her hypothesis, but which does not establish its falsity either. This\r\ncan be explained by the inverse relation between the possible evidential value\r\nof confirming and falsifying instances issuing from a test (Poletiek, 2001).\r\nThat is, as the severity of a possible test outcome to support the hypothesis H\r\nincreases, the severity of the other possible outcome from the same test, the\r\none that falsifies H, decreases.\r\nThis relation between the value of a confirmation and of a falsification\r\nimplies a paradox for the Popperian hypothesis tester. This paradox is that\r\nthe more you try to behave according to the prescriptions of falsificationism,\r\nthe worse off you are if you “succeed”. It is only if you find an unexpected\r\nconfirmation that you will benefit from your choice. Popper does not warn\r\nthe reader of this side effect of falsificationism. Instead, Popper proposes that\r\nactual refutations should not be undervalued in science. They are to be seen\r\nas important contributions to knowledge. However, the falsifying tester has\r\nlittle to be happy about if he finds the falsification he pursues, because the\r\nrefutation is not convincing, and no journal will accept his paper describing\r\nsuch a result. The exemplary success stories of falsificationism disguise\r\nits important shadow side, because they actually failed to falsify the theory at\r\nstake.\r\nTo sum up, falsificationism cannot do without inductive confirmation.\r\nAny test situation is an anticipation of the evaluation of a hypothesis in the\r\nlight of the possible results of the test to be performed. Falsificationism is\r\nactually justified by the valuable confirmations it provides. Even if induction\r\nis tactically reduced to “corroboration” in the actual practice of falsifying\r\ntesting, it plays the main role. Falsificationism is exemplified by cases from\r\nthe history of science in which unexpected confirmation of the theory was\r\n340 Poletiek\r\n","uuid":"2d324560-1617-4f7a-aee9-bfaeb5e3c360"},"_type":"pdf","highlight":{"text":["pursued and expected falsification,\r\nbut by those cases in which the actual falsification failed and the <em>test</em>","lies\r\nin the failure of this attempt, and the high degree of corroboration of the\r\nactual confirming <em>test</em>","By contrast, keeping silent about falsifying\r\n<em>test</em> cases that resulted in the expected falsification","of the other possible outcome from the same <em>test</em>, the\r\none that falsifies H, decreases.","results of the <em>test</em> to be performed."]}},{"_id":"pJqSMoIB__mz3Yx-4Y81","_index":"distant_rl_history","_score":26.032267,"_source":{"citeKey":"TCEssential04","created":1160653331000,"fileName":"[R] [[TCEssential04]] TuringA, CopelandB - 2004 - The Essential Turing - Seminal Writings in Computing, Logic, Philosophy, Artificial Intelligence, and Artificial Life plus The Secrets of Enigma.pdf","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[TCEssential04]] TuringA, CopelandB - 2004 - The Essential Turing - Seminal Writings in Computing, Logic, Philosophy, Artificial Intelligence, and Artificial Life plus The Secrets of Enigma.pdf","modified":1658115305000,"pageIndex":498,"pages":622,"text":"We now ask the question, ‘What will happen when a machine takes the part of A in this\r\n[man-imitates-woman] game?’ Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the\r\ngame is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman?\r\nReformulating Turing’s 1952 prediction in these terms produces: It will be at\r\nleast 100 years (2052) before a computer is able to play the imitation game\r\nsuYciently well so that jurors will decide wrongly as often in man-imitates-\r\nwoman imitation games as in computer-imitates-human imitation games, in\r\neach case no questions being barred.\r\n‘Fiendish Expert’ Objections to the Turing Test\r\n‘Fiendish expert’ objections, of which there are many, are of the form: ‘An expert\r\ncould unmask the computer by asking it . . .’.

(Some other objections to the test are discussed in the introduction to\r\nChapter 11.)\r\nAn interesting example is put forward by Robert French.6 French’s objection\r\ninvolves the phenomenon of associative priming, observed in what psychologists\r\ncall the word/non-word recognition task. A subject seated in front of a screen is\r\npresented for a brief time with what may or may not be a word (e.g. ‘dog ’,\r\n‘dok ’). If the subject recognizes the letters as a word he or she must press a\r\nbutton. The experimenter measures the time that the subject takes to respond. It\r\nis found that, on average, subjects require less time to recognize a word if the\r\nword is preceded by a brief presentation of an associated word (e.g. ‘Wsh’ may\r\nfacilitate the recognition of ‘chips’, ‘bread’ of ‘butter’). French’s claim is that this\r\npriming eVect may be used to unmask the computer in the Turing test:\r\nThe Turing Test interrogator makes use of this phenomenon as follows. The day before the\r\nTest, she selects a set of words (and non-words), runs the lexical decision task on the\r\ninterviewees and records average recognition times.

Virtually the only way a machine could determine,\r\neven on average, all of the associative strengths between human concepts is to have\r\nexperienced the world as the human candidate and the interviewers had.7\r\nTuring, however, was happy to rule out expert jurors. In ‘Can Automatic\r\nCalculating Machines Be Said to Think’ he said that the interrogator ‘should\r\nnot be expert about machines’ (p. 495), and in chapter 10, describing the chess-\r\nplayer version of the test, he said that the discriminator should be a ‘rather poor’\r\nchess player (p. 431).

They are also\r\ncentral to the mathematical objects that PSRs rely on for theoretical results, as well\r\nas most learning algorithms for PSRs. This is because from any given history, there\r\nis some distribution over possible future sequences of actions and observations that\r\ncan be captured through the use of tests: each possible future corresponds to a dif-\r\nferent test, and there is some (possibly zero) probability that each test will occur\r\nfrom every history.\r\nWe now define the prediction for a test t = a1o1a2o2 · · ·anon. We assume that\r\nthe agent is starting in history h = a1o1a2o2 · · ·amom, meaning that it has taken the\r\nactions specified in h and seen the observations specified in h. The prediction of test\r\nt is defined to be the probability that the next n observations are exactly those in t,\r\ngiven that the next n actions taken are exactly those in t:\r\np(t|h) = Pr(om+1 = o1,om+2 = o2, · · · ,om+n = on|h,am+1 = a1, · · · ,am+n = an).\r\nThe actions in the test are executed in an open-loop way, without depending on any\r\nfuture information, so Pr(an|a1,o1, · · · ,an−1,on−1) = Pr(an|a1, · · · ,an).

(Later we will expand on this to allow different errors to have different costs, in\r\neffect giving partial credit for answers that are “almost” correct.) We can estimate the error\r\nrate of a hypothesis by giving it a test: measure its performance on a test set of examples. It\r\nwould be cheating for a hypothesis (or a student) to peek at the test answers before taking the\r\ntest. The simplest way to ensure this doesn’t happen is to split the examples you have into\r\ntwo sets: a training set to create the hypothesis, and a test set to evaluate it.\r\nIf we are only going to create one hypothesis, then this approach is sufficient. But often\r\nwe will end up creating multiple hypotheses: we might want to compare two completely\r\ndifferent machine learning models, or we might want to adjust the various “knobs” within\r\none model.

We then perform k rounds of learning; on each round 1/k\r\nof the data are held out as a validation set and the remaining examples are used as the training\r\nset. The average test set score of the k rounds should then be a better estimate than a single\r\nscore. Popular values for k are 5 and 10—enough to give an estimate that is statistically likely\r\nto be accurate, at a cost of 5 to 10 times longer computation time. The extreme is k = n, also\r\nknown as leave-one-out cross-validation or LOOCV. Even with cross-validation, we stillLOOCV\r\nneed a separate test set.\r\nIn Figure 19.1 (page 672) we saw a linear function underfit the data set, and a high-\r\ndegree polynomial overfit the data.

He and his friends would drip ink \r\non a paper, fold it, and then say what they \r\nsaw in the resulting blot (Sdorow, 2005). \r\nDo you see predatory animals or weap-\r\nons? Perhaps you have aggressive tenden-\r\ncies. But is this a reasonable assumption? \r\nThe answer varies. \r\nSome clinicians cherish the Rorschach, even offering Rorschach-based assess-\r\nments of criminals’ violence potential. Others view the test as a source of sugges-\r\ntive leads, an icebreaker, or a revealing interview technique.\r\nCritics of the Rorschach insist the test is no emotional MRI. They argue that only \r\na few of the many Rorschach-derived scores, such as those for cognitive impair-\r\nment and thought disorder, have demonstrated reliability and validity (Mihura et \r\nal., 2013, 2015; Wood et al., 2015). And inkblot assessments have inaccurately diag-\r\nnosed many normal adults as pathological (Wood et al., 2003, 2006, 2010). \r\nEvaluating Freud’s Psychoanalytic Perspective \r\nand Modern Views of the Unconscious\r\n 13-8 How do contemporary psychologists view Freud’s psychoanalysis?\r\nMODERN RESEARCH CONTRADICTS MANY OF FREUD’S IDEAS We cri-\r\ntique Freud from a twenty-first-century perspective, a perspective that itself will \r\nbe subject to revision. Freud did not have access to neurotransmitter or DNA \r\nstudies, or to all that we have since learned about human development, thinking, \r\nand emotion. To criticize his theory by comparing it with today’s thinking, some \r\nsay, is like criticizing Henry Ford’s Model T by comparing it with today’s hybrid \r\ncars. How tempting it always is to judge people in the past from our perspective \r\nin the present.\r\nBut both Freud’s devotees and detractors agree that recent research contra-\r\ndicts many of his specific ideas. Today’s developmental psychologists see our \r\ndevelopment as lifelong, not fixed in childhood. They doubt that infants’ neural \r\nnetworks are mature enough to sustain as much emotional trauma as Freud \r\nassumed. Some think Freud overestimated parental influence and underesti-\r\nmated peer influence. They also doubt that conscience and gender identity form \r\nas the child resolves the Oedipus complex at age 5 or 6. We gain our gender \r\nidentity earlier, and those who become strongly masculine or feminine do so \r\neven without a same-sex parent present. And they note that Freud’s ideas about \r\nchildhood sexuality arose from stories of childhood sexual abuse told by his \r\nfemale patients—stories that some scholars believe Freud expressed skepticism \r\nabout, and attributed to his patients’ own childhood sexual wishes and conflicts \r\n (Esterson, 2001; Powell & Boer, 1994). Today, we understand how Freud’s \r\n questioning might have created false  memories of abuse, and we also know that \r\nchildhood sexual abuse does happen.\r\nModern dream research disputes Freud’s belief that dreams disguise and fulfill \r\nwishes. And slips of the tongue can be explained as competition between simi-\r\nlar verbal choices in our memory network. Someone who says “I don’t want to do \r\nthat—it’s a lot of brothel” may simply be blending bother and trouble (Foss & Hakes, \r\n1978).

The Sequential Test Procedure: General Definitions\r\n 2.1. Notion of a sequential test. In current tests of hypotheses the number of\r\n observations is treated as a constant for any particular problem. In sequential\r\n tests the number of observations is no longer a constant, but a random variable.\r\n In what follows the symbol n is used for the number of observations required by\r\n a sequential test and the symbol N is used when the number of observations is\r\n treated as a constant.\r\n Sequential tests can be described as follows: For each positive integer m the\r\n m-dimensional sample space Mm is subdivided into three mutually exclusive\r\n parts R?, R' and Rm. After the first observation xi has been drawn Ho is\r\n accepted if xi lies in R?, Ho is rejected (i.e., H1 is accepted) if xi lies in R', or a\r\n second observation is drawn if xi lies in R1. If the third decision is reached and\r\n a second observation x2 drawn, Ho is accepted, H1 is accepted, or a third observa-\r\n tion is drawn according as the point (xl, x2) lies in R?, R' or in R2. If (xl, x2)\r\n lies in R2, a third observation X3 is drawn and one of the three decisions is made\r\n according as (X1, X2, x3) lies in R?, R3 or in R3, etc. This process is stopped\r\n wvhen, and only when, either the first decision. or the second decision is reached.\r\n Let n be the number of observations at which the process is terminated. Then\r\n n is a random variable, since the value of n depends on the outcome of the\r\n observations. (It will be seen later that the probability is one that the sequential\r\n process will be terminated at some finite stage.)\r\n We shall denote by Eo(n) the expected value of n if Ho is true and by El(n)\r\n the expected value of n if H1 is true. These expected values, of course, depend\r\n on the sequential test used. In order to put this dependence in evidence, we\r\n shall occasionally use the symbols Eo(n I S) and El(n I S) to denote the values\r\n Eo(n) and El(n), respectively, when the sequential test S is applied.\r\n 2.2. Efficency of a sequenti-al test. As in the current test procedure, errors of\r\n two kinds may be committed in sequential analysis. We may reject Ho when\r\n it is true (error of the first kind), or we may accept Ho when H1 is true (error of\r\n the second kind). With any sequential test there will be associated two num-\r\n bers a and ,B between 0 and 1 such that if Ho is true the probability is a that we\r\n shall commit an error of the first kind and if H1 is true, the probability is : that\r\n we shall commit an error of the second kind. We shall say that two sequential\r\n tests S and S' are of equal strength if the values a and ,B associated with S are\r\n equal to the corresponding values a' and ,' associated with S'. If a < a' and\r\n ,B < ,B', or if a < a' and ,B < ,B', we shall say that S is stronger than S'(S' is\r\n weaker than S). If a > a' and ,B < ,B', or if a < a' and ,B > g', we shall say\r\n that the strength of S is not comparable with that of S'.\r\n Restricting ourselves to sequential tests of a given strength, we want to make\r\n the number of observations necessary for reaching a fnal decision as small as\r\n possible. If S and S' are two sequential tests of equal strength we shall say\r\n that S' is better than S if either EO(n I S') < Eo(n I S) and Ei(n | S') < El\r\n (n I S), or Eo(n I S') < Eo(n I S) and El(n I S') < El(n I S). A sequential test\r\n will be said to be an admissible test if no better test of equal strength exists.\r\nThis content downloaded from \r\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000128.36.7.77 on Wed, 13 Apr 2022 13:21:42 UTC\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \r\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\r\n","uuid":"5aa08358-13a6-49f9-83ca-8e72c36a3366"},"_type":"pdf","highlight":{"text":["The Sequential <em>Test</em> Procedure: General Definitions\r\n 2.1.

Stephens and Krebs refer to this as the independence of\r\ninclusion from encounter rate principle.\r\nNow let me explain why I have taken the time to present this model\r\nin so much detail. First and foremost this is an example of how eco-\r\nnomically based models of likelihoods and gains can be used in biologi-\r\ncal research. Charnov is trying to develop a full mathematical description\r\nof the problem that evolution engages when foragers develop. Efficient\r\nforagers, by definition, gather more food in less time than inefficient for-\r\nagers. Charnov’s prey model is an effort to describe what makes a for-\r\nager efficient. It is our hypothesis that this is, as Marr might have said,\r\nthe computational goal, or perhaps more accurately, the computational\r\nconstraint that evolution must operate within as foragers evolve. In the\r\nnext section we begin to test that hypothesis by asking how good the\r\nprey model is and how well it predicts the behavior of real animals.\r\nEmpirical Tests of Foraging Economics\r\nThe classic test of the prey model and the assumptions on which it is\r\nbased was made by Krebs, Charnov, and two of their colleagues,\r\nJonathan Erichsen and Michael Webber, in the mid-1970s (Krebs et al.,\r\n1977). Krebs and his colleagues’ goal in designing the following experi-\r\nment was to test two specific predictions of the prey model. First, they\r\nwanted to test the independence of inclusion from encounter rate princi-\r\nple, the hypothesis that whether or not you attack an item is independent\r\nof how frequently you see it (or how frequently you see any less valuable\r\nitem).

However, if the psychologist was an expert on \r\nthe Rorschach, which required subtle interpretation, the psychologist \r\nhad secrets to share and was listened to with some deference because the \r\npsychologist now made clinical diagnoses that had been previously disal-\r\nlowed. To be able to talk of free-floating anxiety and colorshock based on \r\nthe patient’s responses commonly caused many heads about the table to \r\nnod in assent as others on the staff recognized something that had been \r\nseen in the patient. This was worth a great deal to the self-image of the \r\npsychologist, even though doubts arose over the accuracy of the test by \r\nstatistical standards.65\r\nThe Rorschach Test began to lose its place of prominence in the 1970s as \r\nquestions of reliability and validity continued to plague the test, as alterna-\r\ntive objective methods were developed, and as behavioral techniques in \r\nclinical psychology became more prominent.

In any event, it is hazardous \r\nto generalize from her results to those ob¬ \r\ntained under standard conditions (Keppel, \r\n1968, pp. 178f.). Somewhat more convincing \r\nis the finding of Cheung and Goulet (1968) \r\nthat the amount of backward unlearning is \r\nessentially equal for the A-B, C-B and A-B, \r\nB-C paradigms. In the former case the extinc¬ \r\ntive relation obtains between successive back¬ \r\nward associations, in the latter between \r\nfirst-list backward and second-list forward \r\nassociations. \r\nDifferential unlearning of contextual and \r\nspecific associations In the discussion of \r\nMcGovern's results it was noted that the \r\namount of unlearning attributable to the loss \r\nof specific associations, as indexed by the \r\nmatching test, was in general relatively low. \r\nSubsequent studies in which the same or a \r\nclosely similar testing procedure and com¬ \r\nparable degrees of original learning were used \r\nhave yielded comparable results (Garskof & \r\nSandak, 1964; Postman, 1965; Sandak & Gars¬ \r\nkof, 1967; Garskof, 1968). In the case of the \r\nA-B, A-D paradigm the associative losses \r\nappear to be of a considerably smaller order \r\nof magnitude than those attributable to the \r\nunlearning of contextual associations. In \r\nthese studies, however, as well as in \r\nMcGovern's, response recall was required \r\nduring the acquisition of the lists. Compari¬ \r\nsons (either within or between experiments) \r\nof the results obtained on recall and on \r\nmatching tests are, therefore, not conclusive, \r\nfor two main reasons. First, with respect to the \r\nrequirements of the retention task, degree of \r\nlearning may well be appreciably higher when \r\na test of associative matching rather than of \r\nrecall is used. On this basis a difference in \r\nfavor of the former would be expected. Sec¬ \r\nond, the methods of acquisition and of test¬ \r\ning are more nearly continuous for recall than \r\nfor matching; for the latter the shift in the \r\nmode of responding may have an adverse \r\neffect on performance. The resulting decre¬ \r\nment is likely to be greater for an experi¬ \r\nmental group which has had more acquisition \r\ntrials than the control group; the interval \r\nbetween the end of practice and the retention \r\ntest is also shorter for the experimental group. \r\nThese difficulties are largely avoided when the \r\nsame method is used in the acquisition and \r\nin the test stage, recall or matching as the case \r\nmay be, with degree of learning equated \r\nas closely as possible. An attempt to meet \r\nthese requirements was made in the study by \r\nPostman and Stark (1969) mentioned earlier \r\n(p. 1066) in which the recall and multiple- \r\nchoice methods were compared under vari¬ \r\nous paradigms of transfer. An unpaced test \r\nof first-list retention was given at the end \r\nof interpolated learning which permitted \r\nan evaluation of the amounts of retroactive \r\ninhibition relative to appropriate rest groups. \r\nThe test scores are shown in Table 21.6 (with \r\nthe multiple-choice measures corrected for \r\nguessing). \r\nOn the test of recall the amount of retro¬ \r\nactive inhibition varies widely, with the \r\ndifferences among paradigms showing a \r\ncharacteristic pattern. The retention loss is \r\ngreatest for A-D. By contrast, the decre¬ \r\nments on the multiple-choice test are quite \r\nsmall, and there is significant retroactive \r\ninhibition only for A-Br. The loss for A-D \r\nis now negligible. Two additional test trials \r\nwere given to all groups. In spite of the \r\nabsence of feedback there was an upward \r\ntrend in the scores (see Richardson & Grop- \r\nper, 1964).

They “do not talk about ids and egos, \r\nand do not go around classifying their patients as oral, anal, or phallic characters.” \r\nWhat they do assume, with Freud and with much support from today’s psychological \r\nscience, is that much of our mental life is unconscious. With Freud, they also assume \r\nthat we often struggle with inner conflicts among our wishes, fears, and values, and \r\nthat childhood shapes our personality and ways of becoming attached to others.\r\nAssessing Unconscious Processes\r\n 13-7 What are projective tests, how are they used, and what are some \r\ncriticisms of them?\r\nPersonality tests reflect the basic ideas of particular personality theories. So, \r\nwhat might be the assessment tool of choice for someone working in the Freudian \r\ntradition? \r\nSuch a test would need to provide some sort of road into the unconscious—to \r\nunearth the residue of early childhood experiences, move beneath surface preten-\r\nsions, and reveal hidden conflicts and impulses. Objective assessment tools, such \r\nas agree-disagree or true-false questionnaires, would be inadequate because they \r\nwould merely tap the conscious surface.\r\nProjective tests aim to provide this “psychological X-ray” by asking test-\r\ntakers to describe an ambiguous stimulus or tell a story about it. The clinician \r\nmay presume that any hopes, desires, and fears that people see in the ambiguous \r\nimage are projections of their own inner feelings or conflicts.\r\nHenry Murray (1933) demonstrated a possible basis for such a test at a party \r\nhosted by his 11-year-old daughter. Murray engaged the children in a  frightening \r\ngame called “Murder.” When shown some photographs after the game, the chil-\r\ndren perceived the photos as more malicious than they had before the game. These \r\nchildren, it seemed to Murray, had projected their inner feelings into the pictures.\r\nA few years later, Murray introduced the Thematic Apperception Test \r\n(TAT)—a test in which people view ambiguous pictures then make up stories \r\nabout them. One use of such storytelling has been to assess achievement moti-\r\nvation  (Schultheiss et al., 2014). Shown a daydreaming boy, those who imagine \r\nhe is fantasizing about an achievement are presumed to be projecting their own \r\ngoals. “As a rule,” said Murray, “the subject leaves the test happily unaware that \r\nhe has presented the psychologist with what amounts to an X-ray of his inner \r\nself” (quoted by Talbot, 1999).\r\nAlfred Adler “The individual feels at \r\nhome in life and feels his existence to be \r\nworthwhile just so far as he is useful to \r\nothers and is overcoming feelings of infe-\r\nriority” (Problems of Neurosis, 1964).\r\nKaren Horney “The view that women \r\nare infantile and emotional creatures, and \r\nas such, incapable of responsibility and \r\nindependence is the work of the mas-\r\nculine tendency to lower women’s self-\r\nrespect” (Feminine Psychology, 1932).\r\nCarl Jung “From the living foun-\r\ntain of instinct flows everything \r\nthat is creative; hence the uncon-\r\nscious is the very source of the \r\ncreative impulse” (The Structure and \r\nDynamics of the Psyche, 1960).\r\n“The forward thrust of the antlers shows a \r\ndetermined personality, yet the small sun \r\nindicates a lack of self-confi dence. . . .”\r\n©\r\n19\r\n83\r\n b\r\ny \r\nSi\r\ndn\r\ney\r\n H\r\nar\r\nri\r\ns,\r\n A\r\nm\r\ner\r\nic\r\nan\r\n S\r\nci\r\nen\r\nti\r\nst\r\n M\r\nag\r\naz\r\nin\r\ne\r\n For a helpful, 9- minute \r\noverview, visit LaunchPad’s Video: \r\n Psychodynamic Theories of Personality.\r\nprojective test a personality test, such \r\nas the Rorschach, that provides ambigu-\r\nous stimuli designed to trigger projection \r\nof one’s inner dynamics.\r\nThematic Apperception Test (TAT) a \r\nprojective test in which people express \r\ntheir inner feelings and interests \r\nthrough the stories they make up about \r\nambiguous scenes.\r\nCHAPTER 13  PERSONALITY 497\r\nMyersEP10e_Ch13_v3.indd   497 23/11/15   4:51 PM\r\n","uuid":"b2bd3dc7-b126-4f6a-beba-1a1875247b17"},"_type":"pdf","highlight":{"text":["Such a <em>test</em> would need to provide some sort of road into the unconscious—to \r\nunearth the residue of","Henry Murray (1933) demonstrated a possible basis for such a <em>test</em> at a party \r\nhosted by his 11-year-old","A few years later, Murray introduced the Thematic Apperception <em>Test</em> \r\n(TAT)—a <em>test</em> in which people view","projective <em>test</em> a personality <em>test</em>, such \r\nas the Rorschach, that provides ambigu-\r\nous stimuli designed","Thematic Apperception <em>Test</em> (TAT) a \r\nprojective <em>test</em> in which people express \r\ntheir inner feelings and"]}},{"_id":"c5mNMoIB__mz3Yx-7NPS","_index":"distant_rl_history","_score":25.910814,"_source":{"citeKey":"OsgMethod53","created":1284921684000,"fileName":"[R] [[OsgMethod53]] OsgoodC - 1953 - Method and theory in experimental psychology.pdf","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[OsgMethod53]] OsgoodC - 1953 - Method and theory in experimental psychology.pdf","modified":1284931270000,"pageIndex":244,"pages":816,"text":"PROJECTION DYNAMICS IN PERCEPTION 233\r\nmay be observed when two objectively identical small gray squares are\r\nplaced so that one appears against a bright white background and the other\r\nappears against a jet-black background—the former is perceived as defi-\r\nnitely darker than the latter. Color contrast can be produced in several\r\nways: if our identical gray test patches are placed on red and blue inducing\r\nareas, respectively, the former gray appears tinged with blue-green (the\r\ncomplementary of red) and the latter appears tinged with yellow (the com-\r\nplementary of blue) ; or we may place a red test patch on a blue ground,\r\nand the test patch turns toward orange (i.e. the red combines with the\r\ncomplementary of blue, yellow, which yields orange) ; or we may place a\r\npale, desaturated yellow against a deeply saturated blue, and the test patch\r\nbecomes a mure richly saturated yellow. Observe that in every case, whether\r\nfor brightness or for color contrast, the direction of the effect is such as\r\nto maximize the perceived difference between the two regions of stimulation\r\nand hence increase their discriminability. In the case of color, the test patch\r\nis always shifted toward the complementary of the inducing area.\r\nAgain we are dealing with lateral interactions, and it will be profitable\r\nat this point to recast a hypothesis developed to account for summation and\r\ninhibition in the retina (cf. Chap. 4, p. 168). Letting b represent the\r\ntest patch and a the inducing area from which lateral impulses are received,\r\nthe following hypothesis may be phrased : When the impulse rate at a is\r\nless than or equal to that at b, the lateral effects upon b sumtnate with those\r\nbeing delivered directly on this area, increasing the frequency of excitation\r\nof b ; when the impulse rate at a is greater than that at b, the lateral effects\r\nupon b are inhibitory and decrease the frequency of excitation of b. No defi-\r\nnite neurological basis for this inhibitory notion is available, but the entire\r\nquestion of inhibition in neural transmission is very much up in the air at\r\nthis time (cf. Fulton, 1949, pp. 97-103). Nerve cells typically have large\r\nnumbers of boutons upon which the exciting action of other fibers is re-\r\nceived. Although relatively few boutons on receiving cells in b cited above\r\nmight be affected by lateral inputs as compared with direct inputs along the\r\nprojection system, it is conceivable that a rapid rate of subliminal excita-\r\ntion at these points could 'drain off' the electrical excitability of these cells,\r\nraising their thresholds to stimulation along the direct pathways. To in-\r\ncorporate color contrast phenomena, one further assumption must be made;\r\nnamely, that the density of lateral connections is greater between cells medi-\r\nating the same quality (e.g. R with R mechanisms, B with B, etc.) than be-\r\ntween cells mediating different quality. In other words, the effects of R ac-\r\ntivity in the inducing area will be chiefly upon R activity within the test\r\npatch.\r\nHow do these hypotheses apply to contrast phenomena? First, with re-\r\ngard to brightness contrast, this effect is eliminated when illumination of\r\ntest and inducing regions is equal. Although summation is maximal, no dif-\r\nferentiation is produced (and there are no contours). Brightness contrast\r\nincreases with illumination difference between test and inducing regions.\r\nThe more rapid lateral excitation from the bright region depresses activity\r\nin the dimmer region, whereas the slower lateral effects from the dim region\r\nfacilitate activity in the bright region (and contours become stronger).\r\nWhat about color contrast.' When a gray test patch is placed on a well-\r\nsaturated blue inducing area, the gray becomes yellowish.

In the first place, the\r\nbest homonym list shows more generalization to the test list than does\r\nsynonym list I, which included close synonyms of the test words. This is in\r\nflat contradiction to many other data in this field; Traugott (1934),\r\nRazran (1939 a), and Riess (1940, 1946) agree in finding generalization\r\namong synonyms to be greater than among homonyms, at least for adult\r\nsubjects. Secondly, one wonders why the difference between the two\r\nhomonym lists should be greater than that betwTeen the two 'synonym' lists\r\n;\r\nthe former are equivalent but the latter clearly are not. Thirdly, although\r\nrecall after reinforcement with synonym list 11 was not significantly superior\r\nto that after the control list, it is surprising that there should be any dif-\r\nference at all, since the words on synonym list 11 bear no relation to the\r\ntest words—witness killed—sent, ship—vein, result—pear, factory-sow, and\r\nso on. The investigators' assumption was that the words on synonym list II\r\nmediated those on synonym list 1 which in turn provided mediated rein-\r\nforcement of the test words. In searching for an explanation of these points,\r\na flaw in design was discovered that renders the entire technique suspect.\r\nSince all the words on a given reinforcement list bore the same relation to\r\nthose on the test list, all a subject had to do was to 'catch on' to this rela-\r\ntion and then proceed to literally manufacture the test list rather than re-\r\ncall it. The subject is given four trials on the reinforcement list and pre-\r\nsumably learns most of it. If, after the single presentation of the test list,\r\nhe realizes that the new words are homonyms of those he already knows,\r\nthen recalling cent, vain, and pare, he can easily manufacture sent, vein,\r\nand pear, checking them through recognition. Realizing that the new words\r\nare synonyms of those he already knowr\r\ns and then recalling dispatched, ves-\r\nsel, and fruit, he can manufacture sent, vein, and pear. The obtained differ-\r\nences between homonym and synonym lists could be due to the fact there\r\nare fewer alternatives in the former case.\r\nThis loophole in design is even more apparent in later experiments of\r\nthis series. In a study on antonym gradients (Cofer, Janis, and Rowell,\r\n1943), the authors themselves point out that of the 28 subjects given the\r\nantonym reinforcement list, 19 clearly recognized the antonym relation and\r\nshowed better recall than those who did not. In a third study (Foley and\r\nMathews, 1943), the reinforcement list was made up of Spanish words\r\nand the test list of their English equivalents. Two groups of subjects were\r\ntested before and after a month's interval, the experimental group receiv-\r\ning training in a Spanish course throughout this time. The experimental\r\ngroup showed a significant increase in 'transfer' to the test list after the\r\ntraining interval, but the control group did not. Having learned the mean-\r\nings of the Spanish words (e.g. ciudad means 'city'), the subjects were\r\nliterally practicing the English test-list words during their four reinforce-\r\nment trials. It is unfortunate that this flaw in design is present in these\r\nexperiments ; the underlying mediation conception which Cofer and Foley\r\nhave described in theory is certainly an important contribution. Flaws of\r\nthis type are the most difficult methodological errors to catch when de\r\nsigning research—the experimenter, intent on the relevance of his tech\r\nnique to theory and on the elimination of subtle variables, is very likely to\r\n","uuid":"70683189-7adf-4a7e-b4b6-d7fc45e8188e"},"_type":"pdf","highlight":{"text":["In the first place, the\r\nbest homonym list shows more generalization to the <em>test</em> list than does\r\nsynonym","list I, which included close synonyms of the <em>test</em> words.","there should be any dif-\r\nference at all, since the words on synonym list 11 bear no relation to the\r\n<em>test</em>","Since all the words on a given reinforcement list bore the same relation to\r\nthose on the <em>test</em> list,","If, after the single presentation of the <em>test</em> list,\r\nhe realizes that the new words are homonyms of those"]}},{"_id":"t5mOMoIB__mz3Yx-HtyY","_index":"distant_rl_history","_score":25.910814,"_source":{"citeKey":"BodMind08","created":1211626080000,"fileName":"[R] [[BodMind08]] BodenM - 2008 - Mind as Machine - A History of Cognitive Science.pdf","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[BodMind08]] BodenM - 2008 - Mind as Machine - A History of Cognitive Science.pdf","modified":1658063706000,"pageIndex":1403,"pages":1680,"text":"16.ii.c: The Turing Test: Then and now 1355\r\nspeech synthesizer: see 9.xi.g.) These voices may be not only humanlike, but plausibly\r\nidiosyncratic: early-millennial speech-synthesizers can pronounce written text in many\r\ndifferent local accents (9.xi.g). Similarly, someone wanting a computerized ‘‘com-\r\npanion’’ may well prefer to hear a pleasing human-like voice, and familiar regional\r\npronunciation (see 13.vi.d). In the general case, however, the Turing Test is irrelevant\r\nfor AI.\r\nOr rather, the Turing Test as philosophers normally understand it is irrelevant. In\r\na recent issue of the AI Magazine devoted to a twenty-five-year retrospective on AI,\r\none of the invited articles did indeed discuss the Turing Test. It even declared that\r\n‘‘the test still stands as a grand challenge for artificial intelligence, it is part of how we\r\ndefine ourselves as a field, it won’t go away’’ (P. R. Cohen 2005: 61). But its title was\r\na give-away: ‘If Not [sic] Turing’s Test, Then What?’ For the writer was arguing that\r\n‘‘Turing’s test is not irrelevant, though its role has changed over the years . . . [Among] AI\r\nresearchers, the question is no longer, ‘What should we do to pass the test?’ but, ‘Why\r\ncan’t we pass it?’ ’’ (italics added). These shifting attitudes to the TT in AI’s professional\r\ncommunity, despite its unchanged role in the minds of the general public (and most\r\nphilosophers), have been noted also by Whitby (1996a) and by Robert French (2000).\r\nIn short: although the test ‘‘won’t go away’’, passing it isn’t regarded as AI’s core goal,\r\nor as the key criterion of its success.\r\nAfter AI programs had entered the public domain, the AI community asked whether\r\npassing the Turing Test—even in the attenuated sense of a program’s evoking trust in\r\nthe user—is actually desirable (cf. Boden 1977, ch. 15). Professional codes of practice\r\nwere suggested, to prevent the production of deceptively ‘human’ systems and to limit\r\nmarketing hype (Council for Science and Society 1989; Whitby 1988). Marketing hype\r\ncontinued, nonetheless.\r\nBut the potential for deception depends on the sophistication of the user. An early\r\nmedical-assistant program (dealing with issues in medical ethics) explicitly reminded\r\nits users that they might have relevant knowledge which it didn’t, and that only they\r\ncould make the decision required (Sieghart and Dawson 1987). Whether such warnings\r\nare appropriate at any given point in AI’s history depends on what the users (in this\r\ncase, medics and paramedics in Great Britain) can be assumed to know about AI.\r\nThis is why Turing’s prediction about the 30 per cent fooling of ‘‘the average\r\ninterrogator’’ failed. It might, perhaps, have been borne out in the underdeveloped\r\nworld. But, by the year 2000, people in technological societies already knew too much\r\nabout what computers can and can’t do. A computer salesman accidentally connected\r\nto ELIZA today wouldn’t ever reach the stage of raging at Bobrow.\r\nAdmittedly, language generation—needed for the imitation game—is still the least\r\nimpressive aspect of NLP research (see Chapter 9.xi.c). Deception in other modes is\r\nsometimes possible. A real-time jazz improvisation system can fool many people for\r\nmuch longer than five minutes (Paul Hodgson, personal communication). A program\r\ncan compose music indistinguishable (by all but experts) from that of Bach, and other\r\nfamous composers (see Chapter 13.iv.b). And I’ve found that a program that interprets\r\nmarks of expression in musical scores (a more complex problem than one might\r\nthink: Longuet-Higgins 1994) can play Chopin’s romantic Fantaisie-Impromptu in C\r\nsharp minor—which lasts about four minutes—so convincingly that even musically\r\nexperienced AI researchers often can’t tell that a computer is ‘at the keyboard’.

That is, \r\nwhether forgetting occurs inside or outside \r\nthe laboratory, interference between succes¬ \r\nsive learning activities may be responsible for \r\nthe retention losses. The interference hy¬ \r\npothesis has not only been highly productive \r\nof empirical research but has also occupied \r\na focal position in theoretical discussions of \r\nforgetting. Thus interference theory provides \r\na convenient point of departure for a discus¬ \r\nsion of the phenomena of forgetting. It is \r\nbecause of these theoretical and empirical \r\ncontinuities that the problems of transfer, \r\ninterference, and forgetting are considered \r\ntogether in this chapter. \r\nDESIGN OF TRANSFER EXPERIMENTS \r\nThe basic question that an experimental \r\nstudy of transfer is designed to answer is \r\nwhether and in what ways the manipulated \r\nconditions of prior training influence perform¬ \r\nance in a test task. Let A represent the training \r\nphase and B the test phase. The desired in¬ \r\nformation is provided by the comparison of \r\nan experimental and a control group: \r\nTraining Test \r\nExperimental A B \r\nControl — B \r\nThe test task is the same for the two groups; \r\nthe difference between the two treatments lies \r\nentirely in the presence or absence of prior \r\ntraining. As in any other experiment, the valid¬ \r\nity of the conclusions about the effects of the \r\nindependent variable depends on the com¬ \r\nparability of the groups subjected to different \r\ntreatments. To obtain groups of equal ability \r\nthe investigator must rely on appropriate \r\nsampling procedures and random assignment \r\nof subjects to conditions. It is also possible \r\nto equate subjects on characteristics known \r\nTRANSFER, INTERFERENCE AND FORGETTING \r\nor presumed to be related to performance in \r\nthe critical task. \r\nThe control group is represented as re¬ \r\nceiving no prior training. A more precise state¬ \r\nment is that the activity of the control group \r\nis not manipulated before the test on B. \r\nActually these subjects engage in a variety of \r\nactivities during the period preceding the test \r\nthat are assumed to be irrelevant to their \r\nsubsequent performance (see Murdock, 1957, \r\np. 314). (The same is true for the activities of \r\nthe experimental subjects prior to the start \r\nof training, but our present concern is only \r\nwith the period immediately preceding the \r\ntransfer test.) A more complete description \r\nof the design is, therefore, as follows, where \r\nX stands for unknown and presumably irrele¬ \r\nvant prior activities: \r\nTraining Test \r\nExperimental A B \r\nControl X B \r\nA difference between the experimental and \r\nthe control group in the performance of B \r\npermits the inference that A is a source of \r\ntransfer. The exact nature of the transfer effect \r\ncannot, however, be specified. Training on A \r\nmay not only establish specific habits that are \r\ncarried over to B but may also serve to adapt \r\nthe subject to the experimental situation and \r\nthe requirements of the learning task. The \r\nobserved transfer is, therefore, likely to reflect \r\na combination of nonspecific and specific \r\nhabits and skills acquired during the training \r\nphase. When interest centers on the specific \r\ntransfer effects attributable to the similarity \r\nrelations between successive tasks, nonspe¬ \r\ncific practice must be given to the control \r\ngroup.

The leaves of the tree carry the numerical \r\nvalues of the utility associated with the scenario (path) leading to each leaf, or \r\nequivalently, the utility of the situation created by the sequence of events leading \r\nto the leaf. \r\nThe objective of finding the optimal strategy can be achieved by a foldback \r\nanalysis: starting with the leaves and progressing recursively toward the root, we \r\nlabel each node by the utility of the situation it represents. Each chance node is \r\nlabeled with the expected utility of its successors, and each decision node is \r\nlabeled with the maximum utility of its successors. This is very similar to the \r\n\"minimax\" scheme used in the analysis of games [Pearl 1984] except that because \r\nof the neutrality of our adversary (nature) it now involves an expectation-\r\nmaximization (exp-max) labeling procedure instead of the min-max procedure \r\nused in adversary games. \r\nEXAMPLE 1 [Howard 1976a]: The buyer of a used car can decide to carry out various \r\ntests with various costs, and then, depending on the test results, decide which car to buy. \r\nThe quality of the car purchased determines the payoff he gets, and since the amount of \r\nmoney involved is relatively small, we shall assume it has linear utility, i.e., the buyer's \r\nobjective is to maximize the expected monetary value. \r\nThere are two possible tests, /, and t2, though the buyer can decide to perform no tests, \r\ndenoted by t0. The cost of the tests are $50 for t, and $20 for t2. There are two candidate \r\ncars, c \\ and c2, and each can be of either good quality, q x, or bad quality, q2. Car c ( costs \r\n$1,500, while its market value is estimated at $2,000, so the buyer stands to make $500 if \r\nthe car is of good quality. If the quality is bad, the repair expenses might total $700, in \r\nwhich case the buyer would lose $200. Car c2 costs $1,150, which is $250 below the \r\nmarket value. Even if it is in bad shape, however, the repairs will cost only $150. For \r\nsimplicity, we shall assume that the buyer must buy either car c, or car c2 and has time to \r\nperform one test at most. \r\nThe buyer knows from experience that the chances that car c, is of good quality are \r\n0.70, while the chances that car c2 is of good quality are 0.80. It is easy to verify that the \r\nEMV of car c, is $290 (0.70x500+0.30x(-200)), while the EMV of car c2 is $220 \r\n(0.80x250+0.20x100). So if no test is done, the buyer will choose car c, , thus securing a \r\nperceived EMV of $290. \r\nTest /1 checks the quality of car cx.

If different operations each define a new concept, scien-\r\ntists will drown in concepts—or so the objection goes. The prospect of drowning \r\nin concepts sounds odd and undesirable on its own, but it also has more tangible, \r\nharmful consequences. Firstly, it is inefficient to produce more and more concepts \r\nin  situations where one or two could do the job. Second, an ever-increasing stock \r\nof operational concepts is a threat to comparability. If researchers have two tests of \r\nwell-being, and one of them is strongly positively correlated with income while the \r\nother is not, are they to conclude that well-being both is and is not associated with \r\nincome? They might have to accept that conclusion, if they believe that both tests \r\ndefine a distinct concept of well-being.\r\n3.2  Antirealism\r\nIt is often thought that operationalism is an antirealist view (Lovett & Hood, 2011; \r\nMaul & McGrane, 2017).5 It is, in other words, thought that operationalists deny the \r\ntest-independent existence of the attributes their measures apparently pertain to and/\r\nor they deny the possibility of epistemic access to a test-independent attribute. On \r\nthis view, for example, operationalists define depression in terms of a test because \r\nthey believe either (i) that there is nothing more to depression than the way people \r\nbehave in depression tests (i.e. there is no independent cause to these symptoms), \r\nor (ii) that there is no way to access the test-independent determinant of that behav-\r\niour. By test-independent attribute I mean an attribute that can be fully characterized \r\nwithout mentioning the operation used to measure it. For example, cognitive assess-\r\nment of satisfaction with one’s life (whether or not it is observed) is a test-independ-\r\nent attribute, and the concept that denotes that attribute is a non-operational concept. \r\nOn the other hand, self-reports in response to the Satisfaction with Life Scale is a \r\ntest-dependent attribute (or property, or quality, whatever term one likes), and it is \r\ndenoted by an operational concept.\r\nThere are, of course, philosophical defences of antirealism. But many people \r\nbelieve that science, including psychology, ought to study entities and phenomena \r\nthat exist (in some sense) independent of scientists’ tests and measures. To such \r\npeople, information about how people answer to questions about their moods seems \r\nlike a pale and useless shadow compared to substantive knowledge about what \r\ndrives those test responses, e.g. depression qua independent, potentially causally \r\n5 Antirealism (and realism) comes in many forms but I will focus on the styles most relevant to opera-\r\ntionalism, as described in (Lovett & Hood, 2011).

They observed that there was more aggressive behavior (less \r\nevidence of habituation) in the second session when it was conducted in a \r\ndifferent location in the aquarium from the first session, than when it was \r\nconducted in the same location as the first session. \r\nOne reason to be less than convinced that this kind of evidence ot context \r\nspecificity is due to associatively generated priming of STM is that it is \r\npossible to assume that the subject habituated to a total pattern, or Gestalt, \r\nwhich included not only the behavior-releasing stimulus, but also contextual \r\ncues. Changing the test environment would thus be equivalent to a stimulus- \r\ngeneralization test. Or, it is possible to assume that the subject habituated \r\nindependently to both the releasing stimulus and the contextual cues. \r\nChanging the test environment might thus be viewed as a nonspecific sen¬ \r\nsitization manipulation. \r\nIn this light the most powerful test of the notion that the contextual cues \r\nmay act via the associative network to excite stimulus representation in \r\nmemory follows from the extinction manipulation employed in the aforemen¬ \r\ntioned studies of latent inhibition by Wagner, Pfautz, and Donegan. \r\nA relevant habituation study was conducted in collaboration with Jesse W. \r\nWhitlow and Penn L. Pfautz (reported in Wagner, 1976), using the same \r\nvasomotor preparation employed by Whitlow (1975). In initial training, 2 \r\ngroups of rabbits were subjected to a 2-hr habituation session during which \r\na 1-sec tonal stimulus was presented on 32 occasions with a 150-sec inter¬ \r\nstimulus interval. The frequency of the habituation stimulus for half of each \r\ngroup was 530 Hz and for the remainder 4000 Hz. All subjects were re¬ \r\nturned for a retention test 2 days later. The only difference in treatment of \r\nthe 2 groups was that on the intervening day one group (Control) was \r\nsimply left in their home cages, while the other group (Extinguished) was \r\nplaced in the experimental chamber, had the recording apparatus attached, \r\nand was treated exactly as during the previous habituation session except \r\nthat no tones were presented. On the retention day all subjects received a \r\nseries of 32 exposures to the previously habituated tone, as in session 1, and \r\n2 test exposures to the alternate frequency tone. \r\nFigure 3.6 summarizes the essential data from this experiment. In each \r\npanel is presented the averaged evoked response, at 5-sec intervals preceding \r\nand following the test stimulus, for each group. The left panel indicates the \r\ninitial level of responding to the to-be-habituated stimulus (designated A) as \r\nit shows the averaged response to the first 2 tone presentations in the train¬ \r\ning session for both groups. The middle panel indicates the responding of \r\nthe 2 groups to the comparable 2 tone presentations at the beginning of the \r\nretention test session. The major effect is obvious in these data.

I did not come out \r\nfrom the underground until several years later. \r\nIn 10th grade, I was suspicious that the Biological Science Curric- \r\nulum Study (BSCS) biology program we were using was not really \r\nteaching us much biology. So, with the support of my biology teacher, \r\nMrs. Stewart, I designed an experiment to test how scores of the stu- \r\ndents in BSCS biology would compare with those of comparable stu- \r\ndents in the standard biology course, both for the BSCS exams and the \r\nstandard exams. True to my prediction, the two groups did equally well \r\non the BSCS test, but the students in the standard course outperformed \r\nthe BSCS students on the standard exam. \r\nThe summer after 10th grade, I went to a summer program in ma- \r\nrine biology, and the program directors were not thrilled when I pro- \r\nposed to study human intelligence, but they caved in. So I studied the \r\neffects of distractions on mental test performance and discovered that \r\nneither a car headlight shining in one's eyes nor a metronome disrupted \r\nmental test performance, but a Beatles record playing \"She's Got the \r\nDevil in Her Heart\" improved mental test performance. \r\nA year later, my physics teacher, Mr. Genzer, was wonderfully sup- \r\nportive when I did a strange physics project, the development of a phys- \r\nics aptitude test. I was trying, in part, to figure out why I was doing so \r\npoorly in physics. The test correlated about .65 with physics grades and \r\nwas actually used by the high school for several years as a screening \r\ndevice for admission to the advanced physics class. \r\nSo if I ask myself why I can defy the crowd and live with it, I at- \r\ntribute much of it to the wonderful support I had both from my parents \r\nand from early teachers, like Mr. Adams, Mrs. Stewart, and Mr. Genzer. \r\nThey provided an atmosphere where one could go one's own way and \r\nbe rewarded for it. Yet I knew from my seventh-grade experience that \r\nthere were costs, and this is a lesson I keep relearning. \r\nAncient History \r\nI went to college and discovered that not much was going on in intel- \r\nligence research at Yale University.

He had spent his time using calculators to predict \r\nstudents' Yale grade point averages (GPAs) from variables in their ad- \r\nmissions folders, such as scholastic aptitude test (SAT) scores and high \r\nschool GPAs.

The emphasis was on measuring intellectual \r\npower rather than speed, so ample time was allowed for taking the test, and the items \r\nwere gradated in difficulty from very easy to fairly hard. Seeking to demystify test­\r\ning procedures, the psychologists tried to make the test as practical and nonthreat­\r\nening as possible. As Marion Richardson, one of its major architects, noted: \r\nIt was decided that the test should be readily scored by hand, as well as by \r\nmachines; that it ought not to have an esoteric or puzzle-like appearance, but \r\nshould appeal to both officers and men as a sensible practical test so that they \r\nwould take it seriously and have some confidence in the fairness and worth­\r\nwhileness of the scores.

The raw scores, computed by sub­\r\ntracting one-third of the wrong answers from the number of correct answers, were \r\nconverted into standard scores with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 20. \r\nBased on the standard scores, five army grades were established: \r\nArmy Grade Score \r\n1 30 and above \r\nII 1 1 0-129 \r\nIII 90-109 \r\nIV 60-89 \r\nv below 60 \r\n1 3  As Marion Richardson, one of the test's architects, noted: \"Early in 1 940 a general clas­\r\nsification test was prepared and adopted as a stopgap procedure, even though research \r\nconducted outside the War Department between the wars gave rise to much doubt con­\r\ncerning the concept of a single intelligence or general mental ability.\" Quoted in Dav­\r\nenport and Kampschroer, Personnel Utilization, p. 17 .  \r\n14  Quoted in  Davenport and Kampschroer, Personnel Utilization, p .  62. \r\n","uuid":"523cecd5-dcce-4691-8c97-bb6120a46a83"},"_type":"pdf","highlight":{"text":[".,\" or even \"mental,\" psychol­\r\nogists conceptualized the AGCT as a <em>test</em> of general learning ability","Seeking to demystify test­\r\ning procedures, the psychologists tried to make the <em>test</em> as practical and","As Marion Richardson, one of its major architects, noted: \r\nIt was decided that the <em>test</em> should be readily","ludicrous items, \r\nand items that look childish, schoolish, bookish or otherwise out of place in \r\na <em>test</em>","The <em>test</em> consisted of fifty items dealing with vocabu­\r\nlary, arithmetic, and block counting, and took"]}},{"_id":"NJqPMoIB__mz3Yx-2SDH","_index":"distant_rl_history","_score":25.792826,"_source":{"citeKey":"ManPsychology04","created":1117115218000,"fileName":"[R] [[ManPsychology04]] ManktelowK - 2004 - Psychology of Reasoning - Theoretical and Historical Perspectives.pdf","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[ManPsychology04]] ManktelowK - 2004 - Psychology of Reasoning - Theoretical and Historical Perspectives.pdf","modified":1658012496000,"pageIndex":348,"pages":393,"text":"Popper directly derives the degree of corroboration from the severity of test.\r\nThe order of the parameters changes (Popper, 1963/1978).\r\nThus,\r\np(H|e and b)\r\np(H|b)\r\n = \r\np(e|H and b)\r\np(e|b)\r\n(3)\r\nIn his philosophical argumentation, Popper (1963/1978) carefully differenti-\r\nates this measure from concepts such as “degree of confirmation”, “support”,\r\nor “revision of belief”, which are concepts issuing from the rivals of falsifi-\r\ncationism: confirmation philosophies of science. The word “corroboration”\r\nexpresses less persuasion than “confirmation”, in order to fit better within\r\nthe falsification theory, and to avoid association with confirmation theories.\r\nThis distinction, however crucial in the philosophical respect, fades away in\r\nthe formal definition. The degree of corroboration of a hypothesis H by a\r\npiece of evidence e is thus exactly the same as the test severity it represents\r\nfor H.\r\nEven more, the degree of corroboration is exactly the same measure as the\r\n“degree of confirmation”, or “revision of belief” in confirmation theories.\r\nDegree of confirmation of a hypothesis by evidence e is defined in both\r\nBayesian theory (Howson & Urbach, 1989), and Logical Positivism (called\r\nthe “relevance ratio”, Carnap, 1950), as the ratio of the probability of\r\nhypothesis H, given the evidence e, to the unconditionalized probability of\r\nthe hypothesis H. Thus, the degree of corroboration is equivalent to the\r\ndegree of confirmation. By force of this equivalence, the degree of con-\r\nfirmation is also equivalent to the degree of severity of test (3). This is the\r\nfar-reaching consequence of the formalizations of severity of test and degree\r\nof corroboration that Popper (1963/1978) proposed. Interestingly, due to\r\nthis formalization, not only can the formal equivalence relation between his\r\ntheory and its rival be demonstrated, but it also opens the possibility of these\r\nprinciples (degree of confirmation and severity of test) being equivalent in\r\nterms of behaviour. Besides the formal equivalence, the falsificationist\r\nstandard also becomes indistinguishable from the confirmationist one, at\r\nthe behavioural level. At a behavioural level, the question is: what piece of\r\nevidence should we prefer in order to behave as a good falsificationist, and\r\nwhich one in order to behave as a good confirmationist, i.e. to make good\r\ninductions? The striking answer is that the same evidence should be looked\r\nfor because, by implication of the equivalence between the severity of test and\r\nthe degree of confirmation, the evidence that maximizes the severity of test\r\nnecessarily maximizes the degree of confirmation.\r\nThe difference between the two principles lies mainly in the abstract\r\nbackground and the philosophical history. Also, both measures look at the\r\ntesting process from a different angle. In the severity function, the falsifying\r\nelement lies in the risk that is taken regarding the probability of getting\r\na falsification out of the test; that is, the risk of not obtaining support e,\r\n338 Poletiek\r\n","uuid":"cd35965a-f86a-41b2-8ccd-2c7c04a139f2"},"_type":"pdf","highlight":{"text":["Popper directly derives the degree of corroboration from the severity of <em>test</em>.","degree of corroboration of a hypothesis H by a\r\npiece of evidence e is thus exactly the same as the <em>test</em>","of this equivalence, the degree of con-\r\nfirmation is also equivalent to the degree of severity of <em>test</em>","This is the\r\nfar-reaching consequence of the formalizations of severity of <em>test</em> and degree\r\nof corroboration","and\r\nthe degree of confirmation, the evidence that maximizes the severity of <em>test</em>\r\nnecessarily maximizes"]}},{"_id":"vZqRMoIB__mz3Yx-S1eg","_index":"distant_rl_history","_score":25.792826,"_source":{"citeKey":"WalSequential45","created":1470492231000,"fileName":"[R] [[WalSequential45]] WaldA - 1945 - Sequential Tests of Statistical Hypotheses.pdf","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[WalSequential45]] WaldA - 1945 - Sequential Tests of Statistical Hypotheses.pdf","modified":1599779636000,"pageIndex":38,"pages":71,"text":" 154 A.

Efficiency of the sequential probability ratio test. Let S be any sequen-\r\n tial test for which the probability of an error of the first kind is a, the prob-\r\n ability of an error of the second kind is 1 and the probability that the test\r\n procedure will eventually terminate is one. Let S' be the sequential prob-\r\n ability ratio test whose strength is equal to that of S. We shall prove that the\r\n sequential probability ratio test is an optimum test, i.e., that Ei(n I S) >\r\n Ej(n I S') (i = 0, 1), if for S' the excess of Zn over log A and log B can be neg-\r\n lected. This excess is exactly zero if z can take only the values d and - d\r\n and if log A and log B are integral multiples of d. In any other case the excess\r\n will not be identically zero. However, if I Ez I and a- are sufficiently small,\r\n the excess of Zn over log A and log B is negligible.\r\n For any random variable u we shall denote by E*'(u I S) the conditional\r\n expected value of u under the hypothesis Hi (i 0, 1) and under the restriction\r\nThis content downloaded from \r\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000128.36.7.77 on Wed, 13 Apr 2022 13:21:42 UTC\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000:34:56 UTC \r\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\r\n","uuid":"61ee8fa4-ebb4-4804-9f2d-78e831b21558"},"_type":"pdf","highlight":{"text":["0 has been\r\n determined so that the number of observations required by the current most\r\n powerful <em>test</em>","Efficiency of the sequential probability ratio <em>test</em>.","Let S be any sequen-\r\n tial <em>test</em> for which the probability of an error of the first kind is a, the prob","Let S' be the sequential prob-\r\n ability ratio <em>test</em> whose strength is equal to that of S.","We shall prove that the\r\n sequential probability ratio <em>test</em> is an optimum <em>test</em>, i.e., that Ei(n I S)"]}},{"_id":"d5qTMoIB__mz3Yx-qbH-","_index":"distant_rl_history","_score":25.792826,"_source":{"citeKey":"StaNew14","created":1430957136000,"fileName":"[R] [[StaNew14]] StaddonJ - 2014 - The New Behaviorism.pdf","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[StaNew14]] StaddonJ - 2014 - The New Behaviorism.pdf","modified":1430953830000,"pageIndex":203,"pages":295,"text":"Consciousness and Theoretical Behaviorism 191\r\nfunction.” What is that function? James called it “knowing.” Does the brain-\r\ndamaged person who learns the Tower of Hanoi without knowing he has done \r\nso qualify as conscious, at least in that respect? James would probably say \r\n“no.” So how might knowing be measured? \r\n How Good Is the Turing Test? \r\n These examples illustrate the Turing-test view of consciousness: If a subject \r\ncan make the appropriate verbal report, we will grant him consciousness. I said \r\nsomething about the limitations of the Turing test as an experiment in  Chapter \r\n13 . But assuming that the limitations as to time and variety of questions asked \r\ncan be overcome, surely the test is conclusive? A good behaviorist will accept \r\nthe Turing-test: If you act conscious, you  are conscious. \r\n But this view is not accepted by everyone. A creature that acts conscious but \r\nreally isn’t sounds like a “zombie,” which is not the Haitian creation, but an \r\nimaginary creature discussed by philosophers who looks and talks like you and \r\nme, but lacks  qualia. The zombie image is a recurring theme in fi ction— The \r\nStepford Wives and  Invasion of the Body Snatchers are two modern examples \r\n(the replicants in  Blade Runner had feelings, so perhaps they don’t qualify). \r\nA zombie has no  qualia, but behaves otherwise perfectly normally. It could \r\npresumably pass the Turing test. 9 \r\n Philosopher John Searle is suspicious of the Turing test and made his objec-\r\ntion in the form of his famous Chinese Room allegory: \r\n Simply imagine that someone who understands no Chinese is locked in a \r\nroom with a lot of Chinese symbols  and a computer program for answer-\r\ning questions in Chinese. [my italics] The input to the system consists \r\nin Chinese symbols in the form of questions; the output of the system \r\nconsists in Chinese symbols in answer to the questions. We might suppose \r\nthat the program is so good that the answers to the questions are indistin-\r\nguishable from those of a native Chinese speaker. But all the same, neither \r\nthe person inside nor any other part of the system literally understands \r\nChinese. 10 \r\n There are several objections to Searle’s argument. Most important, I think is \r\nthe  system response: Of course, the man in the room doesn’t understand Chi-\r\nnese. No part of the system “understands” Chinese, any more than any neuron \r\nin your brain understands English.  You, the system as a whole, understand \r\nEnglish; the room-plus-program understands Chinese. And as for that com-\r\nputer program: Where is it written that such a program  could be constructed? \r\nYet without proof that it is possible, the argument is moot. \r\n There are at least two other objections. First is the obvious behaviorist ques-\r\ntion, “If it acts conscious, how do you know it isn’t?” If you answer, “I don’t,” \r\nthen you disagree with Searle, accept the Turing test and disbelieve in zombies. \r\nMy second reaction is: Wait and see.

The test requires a\r\nprogram to have a conversation (via typed messages) with an interrogator for five minutes.\r\nThe interrogator then has to guess if the conversation is with a program or a person; the\r\nprogram passes the test if it fools the interrogator 30% of the time. To Turing, the key point\r\nwas not the exact details of the test, but instead the idea of measuring intelligence by\r\nperformance on some kind of open-ended behavioral task, rather than by philosophical\r\nspeculation.\r\nNevertheless, Turing conjectured that by the year 2000 a computer with a storage of a\r\nbillion units could pass the test, but here we are on the other side of 2000, and we still can’t\r\nagree whether any program has passed. Many people have been fooled when they didn’t\r\nknow they might be chatting with a computer. The ELIZA program and Internet chatbots such\r\nas MGONZ (Humphrys, 2008) and NATACHATA (Jonathan et al., 2009) fool their correspondents\r\nrepeatedly, and the chatbot CYBERLOVER has attracted the attention of law enforcement\r\nbecause of its penchant for tricking fellow chatters into divulging enough personal\r\ninformation that their identity can be stolen.\r\nIn 2014, a chatbot called Eugene Goostman fooled 33% of the untrained amateur judges in a\r\nTuring test.

Furthermore, we know now that the activity of receptors is con­\r\ntrolled by efferents leading to them from the central nervous sys­\r\ntem. As an example, consider the events that control muscular con­\r\ntraction. (Similar, though not identical, mechanisms have also been \r\ndescribed for the various sensory systems.) One third of the \"motor” \r\nnerve fibers that go to muscle actually end in spindles that are the \r\nstretch-sensitive receptors. Electrical stimulation of these nerve \r\nfibers does not result in contraction of muscle; but the number of \r\nsignals per unit time that are recorded from the \"sensory” nerves \r\ncoming from the spindles is altered drastically. It is assumed, there­\r\nfore, that the central nervous mechanism must compare the incoming \r\npattern of signals with the centrally originating \"spindle control” \r\nsignal pattern in order to determine what contribution the muscular \r\ncontraction has made to the “spindle sensing” pattern.

It is well \r\nestablished that the motivational state of rats is a major determinant of their instrumental perfor-\r\nmance; not surprisingly, hungry animals work more vigorously for a food reward than sated ones. \r\nBut what current evidence suggests is that this is because a food-deprived state induces an animal \r\nto assign a higher incentive value to nutritive outcomes when they are contacted in that state and \r\nthat this high rating of the incentive value of the outcome is then refl ected in a more vigorous rate \r\nof performance. Although this suggestion stands contrary to general drive theories of motiva-\r\ntion—that suppose that increments in motivation elicit their effects on performance by increases \r\nin general activation (Hull 1943)—there are good empirical grounds for arguing that motivational \r\nstates often do not directly control performance (Dickinson and Balleine 1994, 2002; Balleine \r\n2001). For example, Balleine (1992) trained groups of undeprived rats to lever press for a food \r\nreward (in different experiments this was either food pellets or a maltodextrin solution). After \r\ntraining, half of the rats were shifted to a food deprivation schedule whereas the remainder were \r\nmaintained undeprived before both groups were given an extinction test on the levers. We found \r\nthat performance of the groups on test did not differ even though the shift in motivational state was \r\nclearly effective; in a subsequent test where the animals could again earn the food pellets, the food-\r\ndeprived rats pressed at a substantially higher rate than the undeprived rats. Although motivational \r\nstate clearly did not exert any direct control over extinction performance in the absence of the food \r\nreward, we found, as in taste aversion learning, that motivational state could control performance \r\nif the rats were given the opportunity for incentive learning. This was achieved by allowing the \r\nrats consummatory contact with the instrumental outcome in the test motivational state prior to \r\nthat test. We trained two further groups of rats to lever press when undeprived, before both groups \r\nwere given the opportunity to consume the instrumental outcome when food deprived, prior to a \r\ntest in which one group was tested undeprived and the other food deprived. Now a clear differ-\r\nence in performance emerged; rats tested when food deprived and previously allowed to consume \r\nthe instrumental outcome when food deprived pressed at a higher rate than groups either allowed \r\nconsummatory contact hungry but tested undeprived, or that were not allowed this consummatory \r\ncontact at all (cf. Balleine 1992).\r\nWe were also able to confi rm that this incentive learning effect depended upon the instrumental \r\ncontingency. We trained undeprived rats to perform two actions, lever pressing and chain pulling, \r\nwith one action earning access to food pellets and the other to a maltodextrin solution. All rats were \r\nthen given a choice extinction test on the levers and chains. Prior to the test, however, the animals \r\nwere given six sessions in which they were allowed to consume one instrumental outcome when \r\nfood deprived and, on alternate days, the other outcome in the training, i.e., undeprived, state. On \r\ntest, we found that animals performed more of the action that, in training, had delivered the out-\r\ncome re-exposed in the food-deprived state prior to the test than the other action (Balleine 1992).\r\nA natural interpretation of this incentive learning effect can be drawn from the analysis \r\napplied to taste aversion learning above and presented in Figure 13.3b. When undeprived, any \r\nnutrient-based motivational state should be relatively inactive and so any connection between the \r\noutcome and that state would be productive of relatively little motivational/affective feedback \r\nwhen the outcome is consumed. Hence, one should suppose that the value of the outcome based \r\non that feedback would be relatively low. When food deprived, however, this activation should \r\nbe increased and any motivational/affective feedback produced by the outcome-nutritive state \r\nconnection should now be increased, resulting in an increased emotional response, an enhanced \r\nvalue being assigned to the outcome, and an increase in performance. In subsequent experiments \r\nwe were able to test this account of deprivation-induced changes in the incentive value of food \r\noutcomes using the endogenous satiety peptide cholecystokinin (CCK) and an antagonist of the \r\nCCKA receptor, at which CCK binds to induce its satiety action, MK329 (devazepide). In one \r\nexperiment (Balleine, Davies, and Dickinson 1995), for example, rats were trained undeprived to \r\nlever press and chain pull for the pellet and maltodextrin outcomes and then re-exposed to both \r\noutcomes when food deprived.

They did not know they were in the\r\ncontrol condition and were incentivized to pay attention.\r\nOur main neural hypothesis was that offline replay would facilitate the integration of Stage I and\r\nStage II information, which will in turn support subsequent planning behavior, that is, change in\r\nchoice preferences. In the control condition, participants should not change their choices from learn-\r\ning to test regardless of experienced PEs, while in the revaluation condition, replay should help\r\nthem update previous optimal policy and replan their choice. Note that updating or replanning the\r\noptimal Stage I choice required integration of past information, because the transition from Stage I\r\nto Stage II, on the one hand, and the new Stage II rewards, on the other, were originally experienced\r\nat separate distal points in time during online task performance.\r\nIn our study, the Relearning phase of each block was interleaved with three separate rest periods\r\nof 30 s each. Thus, offline replay could be assessed using brain measurements during these off-task\r\nrest periods. To allow us to measure replay, we used image categories for Stage I and Stage II stim-\r\nuli that were easy to decode with fMRI: All stimuli were either faces or scenes (Polyn et al., 2005). In\r\nparticular, the Stage I (root) stimulus belonged to a different category than the two Stage II stimuli.\r\nThis manipulation allowed us to operationalize ‘offline replay’ using classifier evidence of Stage I in\r\nseparate category-selective regions of interest (ROI) during rest periods, as described below.\r\nReplanning (revaluation) behavior\r\nTo measure revaluation behavior, we computed a replanning magnitude score for each subject and\r\nblock (Gershman et al., 2014; Momennejad et al., 2017; Russek et al., 2017), defined as the pro-\r\nportion of optimal Stage I choices during Test minus the proportion of choices for that same option\r\nduring the Learning phase (see Equation 1 in Materials and methods). We use a score that indexes\r\nchange in preferences here (Gershman et al., 2014), rather than raw Test phase choice behavior for\r\ntwo reasons. First, this is what our hypotheses concern: that replay updates pre-existing choice poli-\r\ncies, driving a change. Second, this score controls for any confounding effects of initial learning per-\r\nformance on Test phase behavior. (For instance, subjects paying different amounts of attention\r\nmight learn to varying degrees in the initial phases, leading to differences in both replay and Test\r\nphase behavior, even if replay itself doesn’t affect later preferences.) In revaluation blocks, this\r\nreplanning magnitude quantifies successful reversal of preference from Learning to Test, because\r\nthe initially suboptimal option becomes optimal during the Test phase. The difference in preference\r\ncaptured by the replanning magnitude compares the frequency of taking the newly optimal action\r\nduring the Test phase to the frequency of taking this action at the end of the Learning phase (when\r\nit was suboptimal), which adjusts for choice noisiness or failure to acquire the initial associations dur-\r\ning the Learning phase. Thus, for revaluation blocks, a large replanning magnitude indicates consis-\r\ntent, successful reversal of an initially consistent, correct preference. Conversely, in control blocks\r\n(where the initially suboptimal option remains suboptimal at test) a large replanning magnitude indi-\r\ncates an unwarranted and suboptimal reversal of the initially trained preference, allowing us to con-\r\ntrol for preference change due to some other, nonspecific source of error such as decision noise or\r\nforgetting.\r\nBehavioral results\r\nComparison of replanning magnitudes revealed that participants showed significant revaluation\r\nbehavior (i.e., reversed their Stage I choice from Learning to Test, as indicated by positive replan-\r\nning magnitudes) in revaluation blocks (t(23) = 4.89, p < 0.0001), but not during control blocks (t\r\n(23) = \u00000.10, p = 0.92), and the difference in magnitudes between the two conditions was significant\r\n(t(23) = 4.333, p = 0.0002) (Figure 2B). The comparison with the control condition verifies that this\r\napparent revaluation behavior is not simply attributable to general forgetting or increased memory\r\nnoise from Learning to the Test phase; rather, it is due to revaluation of past policies in the face of\r\nnovel information in the revaluation condition—but not the control condition. A 2-way analysis of\r\nvariance confirmed the main effect of the reward vs. control factor but revealed no significant main\r\neffect of the reward stability vs. noise manipulation (see Figure 2—figure supplement 1).\r\nMomennejad et al. eLife 2018;7:e32548.
