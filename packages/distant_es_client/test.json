For \r\nexample, if one were to state that a specific IQ test “gets at” the referent of the con-\r\ncept of intelligence, it is legitimate to demand evidence that the test really does \r\nget at that referent. Whereas if intelligence is defined in terms of an IQ test, there \r\nis no epistemic gap between the referent of the concept of intelligence and the IQ \r\ntest—the referent of the concept of intelligence is nothing more than responses to an \r\nIQ test. Local operationalism allows safe passage from test results to claims about \r\nthe target concept by defining away the gap that separates them in methodological \r\noperationalism.\r\n2.2  Local operationalism in the wild\r\nPracticing research psychologists rarely take any explicit stance on operationalism. \r\nRather, they routinely engage in the act of operationalization, which is described in \r\nmany textbooks of psychological measurement. In their textbook, Evans and Rooney \r\n(2011) describe operationalization as an activity that turns a conceptual hypothesis \r\ninto a research hypothesis. A conceptual hypothesis is an intangible claim such as \r\n“Outgoing people have higher well-being than people who keep to themselves” and \r\na research hypothesis is a claim about test outcomes such as “People who score high \r\non standard test E of extraversion give higher ratings of well-being on test W than \r\ndo people who score low on E.” Here “ratings on test T” is an operational concep-\r\ntion of well-being, because it defines well-being in terms of a test, which is a type of \r\nscientific operation.\r\nThe fact that a researcher operationalizes happiness in terms of a rating on test \r\nH does not imply that the researcher believes there is nothing more to happiness \r\nthan the way people respond to test W. One common, epistemically innocent way \r\nto make sense of the act of operationalization is this: the operational concept of \r\nwell-being gets linked back to the “true” concept of well-being when researchers \r\nvalidate test W. For instance, if the true concept of well-being is “frequent positive \r\naffect and infrequent negative affect”, then the researcher needs to ensure that test W \r\ntracks this concept by validating the test. Understood in this way, operationalization \r\namounts to making the intended, non-operational target concept measurable, rather \r\nthan reducing the concept of interest to a more superficial, test-specific concept.\r\nNow, it is true that psychologists routinely validate their measures: they check corre-\r\nlations between the proposed test and tests of related concepts, study relations between \r\ndifferent items (i.e. questions) within the test, and perform factor analysis or an item \r\nresponse theoretic analysis to model the structure of responses to the measure (for an \r\noverview of these methods, see Markus & Borsboom, 2013; Nunnally & Bernstein, \r\n1994).4 But does this guarantee that the measure tracks the intended, non-operation-\r\nally-defined target concept? Many psychometricians, methodologists and philoso-\r\nphers of science have argued that the typical methods of validation in psychology are \r\nsimply insufficient to establish that a psychological test tracks the concept of interest \r\n4 I shall use the term validation in this broad sense throughout the paper.\r\n","uuid":"9aa345e0-c658-4f21-9176-575dda42461c"},"_type":"pdf","highlight":{"text":["For \r\nexample, if one were to state that a specific IQ <em>test</em> “gets at” the referent of the con-\r\ncept","more than responses to an \r\nIQ <em>test</em>.","well-being on <em>test</em> W than \r\ndo people who score low on E.”","in terms of a <em>test</em>, which is a type of \r\nscientific operation.","W \r\ntracks this concept by validating the <em>test</em>."]}},{"_id":"zZmMMoIB__mz3Yx-i5u1","_index":"distant_rl_history","_score":28.117085,"_source":{"citeKey":"MakHandbook12","created":1371120597000,"fileName":"[R] [[MakHandbook12]] MakiU - 2012 - Handbook of philosophy of economics.pdf","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[MakHandbook12]] MakiU - 2012 - Handbook of philosophy of economics.pdf","modified":1656713710000,"pageIndex":422,"pages":926,"text":"400 Marcel Boumans\r\nsatisfying combinations of these tests. As a result, Frisch arrives at the unique\r\nindex formula satisfying the circular test (4), commensurability test (5) and the\r\nfactor reversal test (7). However, Frisch also shows that the base test (3) (or\r\ncircular test (4)), the commensurability test (5) and the determinateness test (6)\r\ncan not all be fulfilled at the same time — they are incompatible. So, one has to\r\nchoose between the tests, which lead to a long discussion in the index literature\r\non the economic meaning and significance of each of them.\r\nAn important consideration for maintaining the circular test is that, when this\r\ncondition is met, an index number is freed from one base year. Another reason,\r\ncrucial to a microeconomic approach, is that the circular test is considered as the\r\nproperty of transitivity, which is essential for any index based on choice theory,\r\nsee former section.\r\nEichhorn’s axiomatic approach is an application of the axiomatic method as\r\npracticed in mathematical logic and is based on Tarski’s model theory. For an\r\naxiomatic system Σ, one of the most fundamental questions to analyze is whether\r\nΣ is consistent. Finding an interpretation of Σ can prove its consistency. An\r\ninterpretation of Σ is an assignment of meanings to the undefined terms of Σ in\r\nsuch a way that the axioms become simultaneously true statements for all values\r\nof the variables. Such interpretation is also called a model of Σ. When the axioms\r\nare formalized as functional equations, inconsistency theorems can then be proven\r\nby showing that for the relevant combinations of functional equations, the solution\r\nspace is empty.\r\nTo analyze an axiomatic system, another crucial question is whether its axioms\r\nare independent. Let A denote one of the axioms of Σ, and the denial of A by\r\n∼A, and let Σ−A denote system Σ with A deleted. If S is any statement phrased\r\nin terms of Σ, let Σ + S mean the axiom system containing the axioms of Σ and\r\nthe statement S as a new axiom. Then, A is called independent in Σ, or an\r\nindependent axiom of Σ, if both Σ and the axiom system (Σ− A)+ ∼ A have an\r\ninterpretation.\r\nThe power of this approach was immediately demonstrated in Eichhorn [1973].\r\nThe paper discusses five of Fisher’s tests:\r\n1. Proportionality test: P (ps, xs, λps, xt) = λ\r\n2. Circular test\r\n3. Commensurability test\r\n4. Determinateness test\r\n5.

In the ‘Turing litigation game’, an interrogator interviews two hidden con-\r\ntestants, one the plaintif and the other the defendant, with the aim of inding out whether the \r\ndefendant is guilty; proponents of this test say that it is cheaper and less cumbersome than cur-\r\nrent legal procedure. It is also oten assumed that the ictional Voigt–Kampf empathy test for \r\nandroids—from the story ‘Do androids dream of electric sheep?’ and the ilm Blade Runner—is \r\nbased on the Turing test. he test also appears in numerous cartoons (including several Dilbert \r\ncartoons), artworks (including ‘he original automatic confession machine: a Catholic Turing \r\nTest’), novels, and short stories—and on tee-shirts and baseball caps (Fig. 27.2).\r\nOne Turing-style test is now widespread. In a CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public \r\nTuring Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart) the judge is a computer whose task is to \r\ntell whether a single contestant is a human or a computer. (CAPTCHAs are sometimes called \r\n‘reverse’ Turing tests.) When you must identify a number in a distorted image before you can \r\nenter a chat room, vote, or use a credit card online, you are a contestant in a CAPTCHA.\r\nBashing the test\r\nSeveral commentators have argued that Turing did not intend his imitation game as a test of \r\nintelligence, and that he would have been amused, even horriied, at the game’s central role in \r\nAI. Marvin Minsky said recently that the Turing test is a ‘joke’ and that Turing ‘never intended \r\nit as the way to decide whether a machine was really intelligent’. Aaron Sloman claims that \r\nTuring was ‘far too intelligent to do any such thing’ and that this widespread misinterpretation \r\nhas led to ‘huge amounts of wasted efort’ discussing the purely ‘mythical’ Turing test. Likewise, \r\naccording to Drew McDermott, all that Turing wanted to do was to ‘shake people’s intuitions \r\nup’.25 Turing’s own words concerning what he called his ‘imitation tests’ make it clear, however, \r\nthat he did intend the game as a test of intelligence. He said ‘I would like to suggest a particular \r\nkind of test that one might apply to a machine’ and he described the question ‘Are there imagin-\r\nable digital computers which would do well in the imitation game?’ as a ‘variant’ of the question \r\n‘Can machines think?’. He certainly seemed to be serious, remarking ‘Well, that’s my test. Of \r\ncourse I am not saying at present either that machines really could pass the test, or that they \r\ncouldn’t. My suggestion is just that this is the question we should discuss’.26\r\nhe Turing test has had a hard ride, and—even though criticisms of the test reduce to a \r\nhandful of unsuccessful arguments—this will probably continue. Critics have described the \r\nTuring test as ‘virtually useless’, ‘obsolete’, and ‘impotent’, and machines that do well in the game \r\nas ‘dead ends in artiicial intelligence research’. Some say that ‘[a]dherence to Turing’s vision . . . \r\nis . . . actively harmful’ and that ‘Turing’s legacy alienates maturing subields’. In the avalanche \r\nof papers celebrating Turing’s centenary in 2012, the same objections appear; critics claim that \r\nthe time has come to ‘bid farewell to the Turing Test’.27\r\nSome of this criticism stems from the fact that the test is a criterion of human-level (or \r\nhuman-like) intelligence in machines. Critics claim that trying to build artiicial intelligence \r\nby imitating human beings is to ignore the essence of intelligence in favour of an emphasis on \r\none parochial example. On this view, the Turing test focuses AI research on uniquely human \r\nbehaviour and so is ‘a tragedy for AI’; the game is ‘testing humanity, not intelligence’.28 What \r\nwe need instead, critics say, is a test of ‘general’ or ‘universal’ intelligence (such as the ‘any-\r\ntime intelligence test’).

But, as Turing \r\nthought, his test may not be cracked for many years yet.\r\nmisunderstanding the Turing test\r\nAnother important misunderstanding about what Turing said concerns deinitions. He is \r\nrepeatedly described in the (now gigantic) literature about the Turing test as having intended \r\nhis test to form a deinition of thinking.41 However, the test does not provide a satisfactory def-\r\ninition of thinking, and so this misunderstanding of Turing’s views lays him open to spurious \r\nobjections, along the lines of ‘Turing attempted to deine thinking but his deinition does not \r\nwork’. Turing did make it completely clear though that his intention was not to deine thinking, \r\nsaying ‘I don’t really see that we need to agree on a deinition at all’,42 but his words were not \r\nheeded. ‘I don’t want to give a deinition of thinking’, he said, ‘but if I had to I should probably \r\nbe unable to say anything more about it than that it was a sort of buzzing that went on inside \r\nmy head’.43\r\nSomeone who takes the Turing test to be intended as a deinition of thinking will ind it \r\neasy to object to the deinition, since an entity that thinks could fail the test. For example, a \r\nthinking alien might fail simply because its responses are distinctively non-human. However, \r\nsince Turing did not intend his test as a deinition, this objection misses the point. Like many \r\nperfectly good tests, the Turing test is informative if the candidate passes but uninformative if \r\nthe candidate fails. If you fail an academic exam it might be because you didn’t know the mate-\r\nrial, or because you had terrible lu on the day of the exam, or for some other reason—but if you \r\npass fair and square, then you have unquestionably demonstrated that you know the material. \r\nSimilarly, if a computer passes the Turing test then the computer arguably thinks, but if it fails \r\nnothing can be concluded.\r\nOne currently inluential criticism of the Turing test is based on this mistaken idea that \r\nTuring intended his test as a deinition of thinking. he criticism is this: a gigantic database \r\nstoring every conceivable (inite) English conversation could, in principle, pass the Turing test \r\n(assuming the test is held in English).44 Whatever the judge says to the database, the database’s \r\noperating system just searches for the appropriate stored conversation and regurgitates the \r\ncanned reply to what the judge has said. As the philosopher Ned Block has put it, this database \r\nno more thinks than a jukebox does, yet in principle it would succeed in passing the Turing \r\ntest. Block agrees that this hypothetical database is in fact ‘too vast to exist’—it simply could \r\nnot be built and operated in the real world, since the total number of possible conversations is \r\nastronomical—but he maintains that, nevertheless, this hypothetical counter-example proves \r\nthe Turing test to be faulty.45\r\nIt is true that the database example would be a problem if the Turing test were supposed to \r\nbe a deinition of thinking, since the deinition would entail that this monster database thinks, \r\nwhen obviously it does not.

Part I deals with the theory of sequential\r\n tests for testing a simple hypothesis against a single alternative. In Part II a\r\n theory of sequential tests for testing simple or composite hypotheses against\r\n infinite sets of alternatives is outlined. The extension of the probability ratio\r\n test to the case of testing a simple hypothesis against a set of one-sided alterna-\r\n tives is straight forward and does not present any difficulty.

The superiority of the\r\n sequential probability ratio test is due to the fact that it requires a smaller ex-\r\n pected number of observations than the current most powerful test.

The number of questions you answer cor-\r\nrectly on an intelligence test would reveal almost nothing. To know how well you \r\nperformed, you would need some basis for comparison. That’s why test-makers \r\ngive new tests to a representative sample of people. The scores from this pretested \r\ngroup become the basis for future comparisons. If you later take the test follow-\r\ning the same procedures, your score will be meaningful when compared with \r\nothers. This process is called standardization.\r\nIf we construct a graph of test-takers’ scores, the scores typically form a bell-\r\nshaped pattern called the normal curve. No matter what attributes we measure—\r\nheight, weight, or mental aptitude—people’s scores tend to form a bell curve. The \r\nhighest point is the midpoint, or the average score. On an intelligence test, we give \r\nthis average score a value of 100 (FIGURE 9.15). Moving out from the average, \r\ntoward either extreme, we find fewer and fewer people. For the Stanford-Binet \r\nand Wechsler tests, a person’s score indicates whether that person’s performance \r\nfell above or below the average. A performance higher than all but 2 percent of all \r\nscores earns an intelligence score of 130. A performance lower than 98 percent of \r\nall scores earns an intelligence score of 70.\r\nIS THE TEST RELIABLE? Knowing your score in comparison to the standard-\r\nization group still won’t tell you much unless the test has reliability. A reliable \r\ntest gives consistent scores, no matter who takes the test or when they take it. \r\nTo check a test’s reliability, researchers test people many times. They may retest \r\npeople using the same test, or they may split the test in half and see whether odd-\r\nquestion scores and even-question scores agree. If the two sets of scores gener-\r\nally agree, or correlate, the test is reliable. The higher the correlation, the higher \r\nthe test’s reliability. The tests we have considered so far—the Stanford-Binet, the \r\nWAIS, and the WISC—are, after early childhood, very reliable (about +.9). When \r\nretested, people’s scores generally match their first score closely. \r\nIS THE TEST VALID? High reliability does not ensure a test’s validity—the \r\nextent to which the test actually measures or predicts what it promises. Imagine \r\nusing a miscalibrated tape measure to measure people’s heights. Your results \r\nwould be very reliable. No matter how many times you measured, people’s heights \r\nwould be the same. But your results would not be valid, because you would not \r\nbe giving the information you promised: real height.\r\nTests that tap the pertinent behavior, or criterion, have content validity. The road \r\ntest for a driver’s license has content validity because it samples the tasks a driver \r\nroutinely faces. Course exams have content validity if they assess your mastery of \r\ncourse material. But we expect intelligence tests to have predictive validity: They \r\nshould predict future performance, and to some extent they do. \r\n FIGURE 9.15\r\nThe normal curve Scores on aptitude \r\ntests tend to form a normal, or bell-\r\nshaped, curve around an average score. \r\nFor the Wechsler scale, for example, the \r\naverage score is 100.\r\n34%13.5% 34% 13.5%\r\n0.1% 0.1%\r\n55 70 85 100\r\nWechsler intelligence score\r\n115 130 145\r\n2%2%\r\nNumber of\r\nscores\r\n68%\r\n95%\r\nAbout 95 \r\npercent of all\r\npeople fall within\r\n30 points of 100\r\nAbout 68 \r\npercent of people\r\nscore within 15\r\npoints of 100\r\nstandardization defi ning uniform test-\r\ning procedures and meaningful scores by \r\ncomparison with the performance of a \r\npretested group.\r\nnormal curve the bell-shaped curve \r\nthat describes the distribution of many \r\nphysical and psychological attributes. \r\nMost scores fall near the average, and \r\nfewer and fewer scores lie near the \r\nextremes.\r\nreliability the extent to which a test \r\nyields consistent results, as assessed by \r\nthe consistency of scores on two halves \r\nof the test, on alternative forms of the \r\ntest, or on retesting. \r\nvalidity the extent to which a test \r\nmeasures or predicts what it is supposed \r\nto.

WALD\r\n A. Introduction\r\n By a sequential test of a statistical hypothesis.is meant any statistical test\r\n procedure which gives a specific rule, at any stage of the experiment (at the\r\n n-th trial for each integral value of n), for making one of the following three\r\n decisions: (1) to accept the hypothesis being tested (null hypothesis), (2) to\r\n reject the null hypothesis, (3) to continue the experiment by making an addi-\r\n tional observation. Thus, such a test procedure is carried out sequentially.\r\n On the basis of the first trial, one of the three decisions mentioned above is made.\r\n If the first or the second decision is made, the process is terminated. If the\r\n third decision is made, a second trial is performed. Again on the basis of the\r\n first two trials one of the three decisions is made and if the third decision is\r\n reached a third trial is performed, etc. This process is continued until either\r\n the first or the second decision is made.\r\n An essential feature of the sequential test, as distinguished from the current\r\n test procedure, is that the number of observations required by the sequential\r\n test is not predetermined, but is a random variable due to the fact that at any\r\n stage of the experiment the decision of terminating the process depends on the\r\n results of the observations previously made. The current test procedure may\r\n be considered a limiting case of a sequential test in the following sense: For any\r\n positive integer n less than some fixed positive integer N, the third decision is\r\n always taken at the n-th trial irrespective of the results of these first n trials.\r\n At the N-th trial either the first or the second decision is taken. Which decision\r\n is taken will depend, of course, on the results of the N trials.\r\n In a sequential test, as well as in the current test procedure, we may commit\r\n two kinds of errors. We may reject the null hypothesis when it is true (error\r\n of the first kind), or we may accept the null hypothesis when some alternative\r\n hypothesis is true (error of the second kind). Suppose that we wish to test the\r\n null hypothesis Ho against a single alternative hypothesis H1, and-that we want\r\n the test procedure to be such that the probability of making an error of the\r\n first kind (rejecting Ho when Ho is true) does not exceed a preassigned value a,\r\n and the probability of making an error of the second kind (accepting Ho when\r\n H1 is true) does not exceed a preassigned value fi. Using the current test pro-\r\n cedure, i.e., a most powerful test for testing Ho against H1 in the sense of the\r\n Neyman-Pearson theory, the minimum number of observations required by the\r\n test can be determined as follows: For any given number N of observations a\r\n most powerful test is considered for which the probability of an error of the first\r\n kind is equal to a.

WALD\r\n If a sequential test S satisfies both inequalities Eo(n I S) < Eo(n I S') and El\r\n (n I S) < Ei(n I S') for any sequential test S' of strength equal to that of S, then\r\n the test S can be considered to be a best sequential test. That such tests exist,\r\n i.e., that it is possible to minimize Eo(n) and Ei(n) simultaneously, is not proved\r\n here; but it is shown later (section 4.7) that for the so called sequential prob-\r\n ability ratio test defined in section 3.1 both Eo(n) and El(n) are very nearly\r\n minimized.4 Thus, for all practical purposes the sequential probability ratio\r\n test can be considered best.\r\n Since it is unknown that a sequential test always exists for which both Eo(n)\r\n and Ei(n)-are exactly minimized, we need a substitute definition of an optimum\r\n test. Several substitute definitions are possible. We could, for example, re-\r\n quire that the test be admissible and the maximum of the two values Eo(n) and\r\n Ei(n) be minimized, or that the mean Eo(n) + El(n) or someotherweighted\r\n 2 , rsm thrwihe\r\n average be minimnized. All these definitions are equivalent if a sequential test\r\n exists for which both Eo(n) and Ei(n) are minimized; but if they cannot be mini-\r\n mized simultaneously the definitions differ. Which of them is chosen is of no\r\n significance for the purpose of this paper, since for the sequential probability\r\n ratio test proposed later both expected values Eo(n) and Ei(n) are, if not exactly,\r\n very nearly minimized. If we had a priori knowledge as to how frequently Ho\r\n and how frequently Hi will be true in the long run, it would be most reasonable\r\n to minimize a weighted average (weighted by the frequencies of Ho and Hi,\r\n respectively) of Eo(n) and Ei(n). However, when such knowledge is absent,\r\n as is usually the case in practical applications, it is perhaps more reasonable to\r\n minimize the maximum of Eo(n) and Ei(n) than to minimize some weighted\r\n average of Eo(n) and Ei(n). Hence the following definition is introduced.\r\n A sequential test S is said to be an optimum test if S is admissible and Max\r\n [Eo(n I S), Ei(n I S)] < Max [Eo(n I S'), Ei(n I S')] for all sequential tests S' of\r\n strength equal to that of S.\r\n By the efficiency of a sequential test S is meant the value of the ratio5\r\n Max [Eo(r, I S*), Ei(n I S*)]\r\n Max [Eo(n S), Ei(n S)]\r\n where S* is an optimum sequential test of strength equal to that of S.\r\n 2.3.

She has \r\nconstructed a test that requires the test-taker to solve various problems: there are \r\nmemory-related tasks, vocabulary tests, mathematical puzzles, tests of inter-personal \r\nskills, and so on. Suppose the intended long-term goal of the scientist is to measure \r\nintelligence understood in non-operational terms, but she does not know what kind \r\nof test-independent attribute or property determines success on these kinds of tests. \r\nIn other words, she does not know whether test success is driven by a specific, uni-\r\nfied cognitive skill, a cluster of such skills, a physical property of the brain, learned \r\nskills, test-wiseness, acculturation, or some other unobservable, but stable and easily \r\ncharacterizable property. What should she say when people ask what her measure \r\nmeasures? One option is to say that, for now, she defines intelligence in terms of the \r\ntest. Intelligence is what the test tests, she argues, echoing Edwin G. Boring’s (1923) \r\nfamous dictum.\r\nHow is this a solution rather than a nasty cop-out? The answer is in the above \r\nphrase “for now”. Because the researcher is cautious, she does not want to hazard \r\na guess, even a relatively educated one, at what kind of test-independent attribute \r\ncauses or determines test responses—indeed, some of the early developers of intel-\r\nligence tests were reluctant to guess what underlies differences between test takers \r\nscores on such tests (see e.g. quotes in Michell (2012)). In other words, since she \r\ndoes not understand the nature of what her measure captures, she cannot say whether \r\nit can be legitimately characterized as intelligence. But the researcher still thinks \r\nthat the tests she has selected reflect pre-theoretic connotations of intelligence, that \r\nis, that there is continuity between the operational concept of intelligence and pre-\r\ntheoretic connotations of intelligence. Indeed, intelligence connotes problem-solv-\r\ning, so a test involving problem-solving has a certain continuity with pre-theoretic \r\nviews of intelligence. Furthermore, the researcher believes her measure has poten-\r\ntial to be developed, and that an appropriately revised measure might well capture \r\nsomething that can legitimately be denoted with a non-operational concept of intel-\r\nligence. For these reasons, the label “intelligence” is appropriate for the operational \r\nconcept the test battery defines, even though the researcher does not know what kind \r\nof test-independent process or entity determines test responses.\r\nIn a situation such as the one outlined above, operationalism does not entail anti-\r\nrealism. In other words, the act of defining the target attribute in terms of a test does \r\nnot signal (i) a denial of the test-independent existence of intelligence, or (ii) a denial \r\nof the possibility of epistemic access to the determinants of test responses. Rather, \r\nthis kind of operationalism is a temporary solution motivated by caution. What the \r\ncaution-driven operationalist is implicitly saying is this: there might be a defensible \r\nconception of intelligence that has a test-independent referent, but I do not yet know \r\nwhat that concept would look like. Furthermore, that concept might be capturable \r\n","uuid":"bc87955c-b2aa-41f5-8b7e-eab86a91b646"},"_type":"pdf","highlight":{"text":["She has \r\nconstructed a <em>test</em> that requires the <em>test</em>-taker to solve various problems: there are \r\nmemory-related","In other words, she does not know whether <em>test</em> success is driven by a specific, uni-\r\nfied cognitive","One option is to say that, for now, she defines intelligence in terms of the \r\n<em>test</em>.","determines <em>test</em> responses.","access to the determinants of <em>test</em> responses."]}},{"_id":"qZqPMoIB__mz3Yx-EwEc","_index":"distant_rl_history","_score":27.884605,"_source":{"citeKey":"MGPPlans86","created":1655772502000,"fileName":"[R] [[MGPPlans86]] MillerG et al - 1986 - Plans and the Structure of Behavior.pdf","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[MGPPlans86]] MillerG et al - 1986 - Plans and the Structure of Behavior.pdf","modified":1658105514000,"pageIndex":42,"pages":236,"text":"inside the operational phase in Figure 3, the result is the hierarchical \r\nPlan for hammering nails that is shown in Figure 5.\r\nIf this description of hammering is correct, we should expect \r\nthe sequence of events to run off in this order: Test nail.

Since infinitely many sequential test procedures exist,\r\n the first and basic problem was, of course, to find the particular sequential test\r\n procedure which is most efficient, i.e., which effects the greatest possible saving\r\n in the expected number of observations as compared with any other (sequential\r\n or non-sequential) test. In April, 1943 the author devised such a test, called\r\n the sequential probability ratio test, which for all practical purposes is most\r\n efficient when used for testing a simple hypothesis Ho against a single alterna-\r\n tive H1.\r\n Because of the substantial savings in the expected number of observations\r\n effected by the sequential probability ratio test, and because of the simplicity\r\n of this test procedure in practical applications, the National Defense Research\r\n Committee considered these developments sufficiently useful for the war effort\r\n to make it desirable to keep the results out of the reach of the enemy, at least for\r\n a certain period of time. The author was, therefore, requested to submit his\r\n findings in a restricted report [7] which was dated September, 1943.3 In this\r\n report the sequential probability ratio test is devised and its mathematical theory\r\n is developed. In July 1944 a second report [8] was issued by the Statistical\r\n Research Group which gives an elementary non-mathematical exposition of\r\n the applications of the sequential probability ratio test, together with charts,\r\n tables and computational simplifications to facilitate applications.\r\n Independently of the developments here, G. A. Barnard [9] recognized the\r\n merits of a sequential method of testing, i.e., the possibility of a saving in the\r\n number of observations as compared with the current most powerful test. He\r\n also devised an interesting sequential test for testing double dichotomies, which\r\n differs from the one obtained by applying the sequential probability ratio test.\r\n Some further developments in the theory of the sequential probability ratio\r\n test took place in 1944. Extending the methods used in [7], C. M. Stockman\r\n 110] found the operating characteristic curve of the sequential probability ratio\r\n test applied to a binomial distribution. Independently of Stockman, Milton\r\n Friedman and George W. Brown (independently of each other) obtained the\r\n same result which can be extended to the normal distribution and a few other\r\n specific distributions, but is not applicable to more general distributions. The\r\n general operating characteristic curve for any sequential probability ratio test\r\n was derived by the author [11]. A few months later the author developed a\r\n general theory of cumulative sums [4] which gives not only the operating char-\r\n 2 Bartky's multiple sampling scheme [21 for testing the mean of a binomial distribution\r\n provides, of course, an example of such a sequential test (see, for example, the remarks on\r\n p. 377 in [2]).

THE REWARD-VALUE OF INDIFFERENT STIMULATION 189 \r\nIII. EFFECTS OF DEGREE OF CHANGE AND CONSEQUENT LEVEL \r\nHaving arrived at a satisfactory demonstration that light increment \r\nhas reward-value for the rat, we set out in search of factors on which \r\nthis reward-value depends. \r\nAccording to one interpretation of photic reinforcement and cognate \r\nto control for this possibility is to conduct an experiment in which, on \r\nTest days, both experimental and control groups undergo the treat­\r\nment that experimental groups received on Training Days. In such an \r\nexperiment, the Test-day situation would be novel for the control \r\ngroup but not for the experimental groups, and if novelty were the \r\noperative factor, the eifect found in Experiment 1 should be reversed. \r\nB. Experiment 2: Light Change during Test Trials \r\nThe second experiment lasted for six days, with Days 2 and 6 as \r\nTest days. Since the YC group had served its purpose in Experiment \r\n1, only an Ε group and an NLC group, each of 22 rats, were used for \r\nthis experiment. On Training days they received light changes and no \r\nlight changes, respectively, when the bar was pressed. On Test days, \r\nevery bar-press resulted in a light change for both groups. \r\nThe Test day means are shown in Fig. 2. Logarithmically trans­\r\nformed scores were higher in the Ε group than in the NLC group over \r\nboth Test days (p < .005) and on Day 2 alone (p < .001). \r\nOver both experiments, the Ε groups pressed the bar significantly \r\nmore often than the NLC groups on Test days 2 and 6 taken together \r\n(p < .005). The means are, however, significantly greater in Experi­\r\nment 1 than Experiment 2 (p < .005), which indicates that perform­\r\nance was depressed by the presence of light on Test days. \r\nIt is possible to see whether there was an effect of novelty by seeing \r\nwhether the Groups x Experiments interaction was significant on Test \r\ndays. This comparison is, of course, now orthogonal to the E /NLC \r\ncomparison. Over both Test days, novelty did not have a significant \r\neffect, but the Novelty x Days interaction was significant (p < .025). \r\nThere were significantly (p < .025) fewer responses on Day 2, but not \r\non Day 6, with a novel Test day condition. We can therefore conclude \r\nthat the novel Test day condition depressed performance when it was \r\nfirst encountered but not later. \r\n","uuid":"1063174b-3bf6-453a-9e9c-de2a45c86b07"},"_type":"pdf","highlight":{"text":["In such an \r\nexperiment, the <em>Test</em>-day situation would be novel for the control \r\ngroup but not for the","Experiment 2: Light Change during <em>Test</em> Trials \r\nThe second experiment lasted for six days, with Days","2 and 6 as \r\n<em>Test</em> days.","On <em>Test</em> days, \r\nevery bar-press resulted in a light change for both groups.","The <em>Test</em> day means are shown in Fig. 2."]}},{"_id":"qJqUMoIB__mz3Yx-P8lX","_index":"distant_rl_history","_score":27.697575,"_source":{"citeKey":"DHPsychology67","created":1314181098000,"fileName":"[R] [[DHPsychology67]] DeeseJ, HulseS - 1967 - The psychology of learning.pdf","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[DHPsychology67]] DeeseJ, HulseS - 1967 - The psychology of learning.pdf","modified":1314186598000,"pageIndex":324,"pages":536,"text":"311 THEORETICAL PROBLEMS IN VERBAL LEARNING\r\nsubjects (with some subject-to-subject and item-to-item variability in\r\nstrength).\r\nTo distinguish between these two possibilities, a repeated testing\r\nis necessary.

A test of retention is provided by presenting\r\nthe nonsense syllables with the requirement that the subjects guess the\r\nnumbers associated with them. Following this test a second test, exactly\r\nlike it, is administered. If the single exposure of the pairs raises strength\r\nto an average of I/2, with some random fluctuation from subject to subject,\r\nit shouldn't matter on the second test whether a particular subject got a\r\nparticular item right or not on the first test. Some of the subjects who\r\nknew an item on the first test would miss that item on retesting, and\r\nsome of the subjects who missed that item on the first test should cor-\r\nrectly guess it on the second.

In this case, psychologists might have some \r\n“theoretical” conception of what the trait is. Such a concept is also sometimes referred to \r\nas a “construct” (e.g., Cronbach & Meehl 1955). The question is how it can be \r\nestablished (a) that the construct in question is accurate (i.e., that the trait in question \r\nreally exists and that its properties are adequately described by the construct), and (b) that \r\nthe test in question really captures the trait that is being represented by the construct? \r\nThese two related issues are addressed by Cronbach & Meehl under the heading of \r\n“construct validation.”\r\n4.6.1 Some General Considerations About the Notion of a Construct\r\nBy “construct” the authors mean “some postulated attribute of people, assumed to be \r\nreflected in test performance” (Cronbach & Meehl 1955, 283).69 The authors want to \r\ndefend the idea that a test measures more than just the test performance. It measures \r\nsomething which the test performance is indicative of, and therefore allows us to make \r\ngeneralizations which go beyond the data gathered in the experiment. For example, if \r\nsomeone scores 100 points on a standard intelligence test, the authors want to say that \r\nthis person is of average intelligence, where “intelligence” is a construct that refers to\r\n69 Once again we see here what seems to be a common confusion in the psychological methodological \r\nliterature, i.e. a failure to distinguish between the mental attribute measured by a test, and the construct \r\nused to describe this attribute. We have already seen an instance o f  this confusion in the earlier quote by \r\nZimbardo (section 4.2.1).

This runs contrary to the suggestion that the computer is\r\nsupposed to imitate a woman (rather than a man or a woman). Moreover in\r\nChapter 14 Turing says that ‘[t]he idea of the test is that the machine has to try\r\nand pretend to be a man . . . and it will pass only if the pretence is reasonably\r\nconvincing’ (p. 495). In Chapter 13 Turing presents the test in a starkly un-\r\ngendered form: here the point of the test is to determine whether or not a\r\ncomputer can ‘imitate a brain’ (p. 485). On balance, then, it seems rather\r\nunlikely that Turing’s intention in ‘Computing Machinery and Intelligence’ was\r\nto put forward a test in which the computer must impersonate a woman.\r\nThe role of the man-imitates-woman game is frequently misunderstood. For\r\nexample, Hodges claims that this game is irrelevant as an introduction to the\r\nTuring test—indeed, it is a ‘red herring’.8 However, the man-imitates-woman\r\ngame forms part of the protocol for scoring the test. Will interrogators decide\r\nwrongly as often in man-imitates-woman imitation games as they do in com-\r\nputer-imitates-human games?

It contains no fewer\r\nthan nine objections to Turing’s position, together with Turing’s rebuttal of each.\r\nOne of them, the ‘Mathematical Objection’, is also discussed in Chapters 10 and\r\n12 (the introduction to Chapter 12 gives some further information about this\r\nimportant and controversial objection).\r\nSince ‘Computing Machinery and Intelligence’ Wrst appeared, Turing’s test has\r\nreceived considerable attention from philosophers, computer scientists, psych-\r\nologists, and others, and numerous additional objections have been raised to the\r\ntest, some of them ingenious indeed. Nevertheless, it seems to me that none of\r\nthese objections is successful (see my chapter in Moor’s The Turing Test in the list\r\nof further reading). A discussion of one such objection, called here the Shannon–\r\nMcCarthy objection, will give something of the Xavour of the debate that still\r\nrages over the Turing test.

The answer depends on \r\nthe definition of bias we use.\r\nTwo Meanings of Bias\r\nThe scientific meaning of bias hinges on a test’s validity—on whether it predicts \r\nfuture behavior only for some groups of test-takers. For example, if the SAT accu-\r\nrately predicted the college achievement of women but not that of men, then the \r\ntest would be biased. In this statistical meaning of the term, the near-consensus \r\namong psychologists (as summarized by the U.S. National Research Council’s \r\nCommittee on Ability Testing and the American Psychological Association’s Task \r\nForce on Intelligence) has been that the major U.S. aptitude tests are not biased \r\n(Hunt & Carlson, 2007; Neisser et al., 1996; Wigdor & Garner, 1982). The tests’ \r\npredictive validity is roughly the same for women and men, for various races, and \r\nfor rich and poor. If an intelligence test score of 95 predicts slightly below-average \r\ngrades, that rough prediction usually applies equally to all.\r\nBut we can also consider a test biased if it detects not only innate differences \r\nin intelligence but also performance differences caused by cultural experiences. \r\nThis in fact happened to Eastern European immigrants in the early 1900s. Lack-\r\ning the experience to answer questions about their new culture, many were clas-\r\nsified as “feeble-minded.” In this popular sense, intelligence tests are biased. \r\nThey measure your developed abilities, which reflect, in part, your education \r\nand experiences. \r\nYou may have read examples of intelligence test items that make assump-\r\ntions (for example, that a cup goes with a saucer). Such items bias the test (in \r\nthis case, against those who do not use saucers). Could such questions explain \r\ncultural differences in test performance? In such cases, tests can be a vehicle for \r\ndiscrimination, consigning potentially capable children (some of whom may have \r\na different native language) to unchallenging classes and dead-end jobs. For such \r\nreasons, some intelligence researchers recommend creating culture-neutral ques-\r\ntions—such as assessing people’s ability to learn novel words, sayings, and analo-\r\ngies—to enable culture-fair aptitude tests (Fagan & Holland, 2007, 2009).\r\nSo, test-makers’ expectations can introduce bias in an intelligence test. This is \r\nconsistent with an observation you have seen throughout this text: Our expecta-\r\ntions and attitudes can influence our perceptions and behaviors. This is also true \r\nfor the person taking the test.\r\nRETRIEVE IT \r\n• What is the difference between a test that is biased culturally and a test that is biased in \r\nterms of its validity?\r\nANSWER: A test may be culturally biased if higher scores are achieved by those with certain cultural \r\nexperiences. That same test may not be biased in terms of validity if it predicts what it is supposed to predict. \r\nFor example, the SAT may be culturally biased in favor of those with experience in the U.S. school system, but \r\nit does still accurately predict U.S. college success.\r\n360 CHAPTER 9  THINKING, LANGUAGE, AND INTELLIGENCE\r\nMyersEP10e_Ch09_v4.indd   360 12/11/15   4:36 PM\r\n","uuid":"5f52398b-e3f2-4487-9793-948e64afc0b4"},"_type":"pdf","highlight":{"text":["Such items bias the <em>test</em> (in \r\nthis case, against those who do not use saucers).","Could such questions explain \r\ncultural differences in <em>test</em> performance?","So, <em>test</em>-makers’ expectations can introduce bias in an intelligence <em>test</em>.","This is also true \r\nfor the person taking the <em>test</em>.","RETRIEVE IT \r\n• What is the difference between a <em>test</em> that is biased culturally and a <em>test</em> that is biased"]}},{"_id":"IJqRMoIB__mz3Yx-tmVg","_index":"distant_rl_history","_score":27.397346,"_source":{"citeKey":"JMAge01","created":1649120962000,"fileName":"[R] [[JMAge01]] Judy Klein, Mary Morgan - 2001 - The age of economic measurement.pdf","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[JMAge01]] Judy Klein, Mary Morgan - 2001 - The age of economic measurement.pdf","modified":1649120962000,"pageIndex":392,"pages":416,"text":"Index 383\r\nIndex numbers, 19, 237-38 \r\nadding with weights to \r\nmake index numbers, \r\n240-42\r\nAxiomatic Index Theory, 314-15 \r\ninstrumental approach versus, \r\n332-38\r\nchanging base, test by, 327\r\nCircular Test, 331-32, 334, 336-37 \r\ngap, 338\r\nCommensurability Test, 328 \r\nconstructing indicators, 245 \r\ndeterminateness as to prices, test \r\nof, 327\r\nFactor Reversal Test, 330, 334-36 \r\ngold, study of, 289\r\n“ideal\" index, 330-31, 347 \r\ninstrumental approach to, 313-44\r\nAxiomatic Index Theory versus, \r\n332-38\r\nconsistency of tests, 332-35 \r\ndescription of, 336-38\r\nempirical test of, 329-32 \r\nindex formulae, tests of, 326-29 \r\nindex-number problem, 323-26 \r\ninventions, 320-23\r\nmaking of index numbers, \r\n323-32\r\nmechanical balance, 325 \r\nnon-Euclidean geometry, \r\n316-20\r\nprice ratios, 324\r\nworld maps and globes, 338-40 \r\nmoney, quantitative assessment of \r\nvalue of, 158\r\nThe Paasche Index, 328, 329, 330 \r\nproportionality as to prices, test of, \r\n326\r\nproportionality as to trade, test of, \r\n326-27\r\nTime Reversal Test, 335, 336 \r\nwithdrawal or entry as to prices, \r\ntest of, 327\r\nIndex Visible Filing System, 320-21 \r\nIndicators, constructing, 245-46 \r\nIndices de dependance, 101\r\nIndifference-defined index, 351 \r\nIndirect measurement, money, 139 \r\nIndirect statistical inference, 196 \r\nIndividualism, 70\r\nInductive quantification, 255 \r\nIndustrial accidents\r\ncompensation to victims, 66 \r\nWork Accidents and the Law\r\n(Eastman), 64\r\nIndustrial management, productivity \r\nand, 72\r\nIndustry.

Indeed, this reasoning is often circular because some\r\nM-S tests inadvertently assume the validity of the very assumption being tested!\r\nA closer look at the reasoning underlying M-S testing reveals that both charges\r\nare misplaced. First, the scenario used in evaluating the type I error invokes no\r\nassumptions beyond those ofMθ(z), since every M-S test is evaluated under:\r\nH0: all the probabilistic assumptions making upMθ(z) are valid.\r\nEXAMPLE 9. The runs test, using the residuals from an AR(p) model {ε̂t, t=1,\r\n2, ..., n}, is an example of an omnibus M-S test for assumptions [4]-[5] (table 4)\r\nbased a test statistic: ZR(Y)= [R−E(R)]/\r\n√\r\nV ar(R); see Spanos [1999]. For n ≥\r\n40, the type I error probability evaluation is based on:\r\nZR(Y) = R−([2n−1]/3)√\r\n[16n−29]/90\r\n[1]-[5]\r\n∽ N(0, 1).\r\nSecond, the type II error (and power), for any M-S test, is determined by eval-\r\nuating the test statistic under certain forms of departures from the assumptions\r\nbeing appraised [hence, no circularity], but retaining the rest of the model assump-\r\ntions, or choose M-S tests which are insensitive to departures from the retained\r\nassumptions.\r\nFor the runs test, the evaluation under the alternative takes the form:\r\nZR(Y)\r\n[4]-[5]&[1]−[3]\r\n∽ N(δ, τ2), δ 6= 0, τ2 > 0,\r\nwhere [4] and [5] denote specific departures from these assumptions considered by\r\nthe test in question. It is important to note that the runs test is insensitive to\r\ndepartures from Normality; one of its virtues in practice. The type of departures\r\nimplicitly or explicitly considered by the M-S test in question will affect the power\r\nof the test in a variety of ways, and one needs to apply a battery of different M-S\r\ntests to ensure broad probing capacity and self-correcting in the sense that the\r\neffect of any departures from the maintained assumptions can also detected.\r\nIn practice, potential problems such as circular reasoning, inadequate probing\r\nand erroneous diagnoses can be circumvented by employing [Mayo and Spanos,\r\n2004]:\r\n(a) Judicious combinations of parametric, non-parametric, omnibus\r\nand simulation-based tests, probing as broadly as possible and in-\r\nvoking dissimilar assumptions.\r\n","uuid":"588f16b0-f1dd-4fe4-b3d1-c36ccb52feca"},"_type":"pdf","highlight":{"text":["charges against M-S testing\r\nThe infinite regress charge is often articulated by claiming that each M-S <em>test</em>","M-S <em>test</em> for assumptions [4]-[5] (table 4)\r\nbased a <em>test</em> statistic: ZR(Y)= [R−E(R)]/\r\n√\r\nV ar(R); see","Second, the type II error (and power), for any M-S <em>test</em>, is determined by eval-\r\nuating the <em>test</em> statistic","For the runs <em>test</em>, the evaluation under the alternative takes the form:\r\nZR(Y)\r\n[4]-[5]&[1]−[3]\r\n∽ N(","power\r\nof the <em>test</em> in a variety of ways, and one needs to apply a battery of different M-S\r\ntests to"]}},{"_id":"N5qPMoIB__mz3Yx-2SDP","_index":"distant_rl_history","_score":27.349287,"_source":{"citeKey":"ManPsychology04","created":1117115218000,"fileName":"[R] [[ManPsychology04]] ManktelowK - 2004 - Psychology of Reasoning - Theoretical and Historical Perspectives.pdf","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[ManPsychology04]] ManktelowK - 2004 - Psychology of Reasoning - Theoretical and Historical Perspectives.pdf","modified":1658012496000,"pageIndex":351,"pages":393,"text":"responsible for the advancement of knowledge. And it seems that falsifi-\r\ncationism is not always the rational way to behave in everyday testing either.\r\nIndeed, the relation between falsifying testing and inductions not only\r\nholds for science. The same intuitions occur in everyday reasoning. Suppose\r\nyou have the chance to buy a 10-year-old car of make R. You want to test your\r\nassumption that R is a good make for your purposes. Your choice is between\r\ntwo tests: consulting the local R-cars dealer and consulting the P-cars dealer.\r\nThe falsifying test prescription for this hypothesis is that you should consult\r\nthe P-cars dealer. If you choose the P-cars dealer, a confirmation of your\r\nhypothesis is quite unexpected. Rather, you expect to hear that R-cars are not\r\nthat good, and that you had better go for a P-car. But suppose that the P-cars\r\ndealer actually confirms, to your surprise, that R-cars are good cars. You\r\nwould be highly convinced of your hypothesis and buy the R-car. However,\r\nthe most probable outcome of your test is that the P-dealer is negative about\r\nR-cars. But then, you would still be in much doubt about the car precisely\r\nbecause you got the information you already expected. By contrast,\r\nconsulting the brand R-dealer will make you expect that you will see your\r\nassumption confirmed, but this will have little impact on your beliefs. How-\r\never, if the R-dealer, surprisingly, is negative about R-cars, this falsification\r\nwill definitiely change your mind! The relation between a falsifying test\r\nstrategy and the inductive power of an actual confirmation, arising from such\r\na test, implies that the more we try to obtain falsification, the less well off we\r\nare if we get it. This is felt in both scientific and everyday hypothesis-testing\r\nsituations.\r\nTRANSLATING POPPER IN PSYCHOLOGY, BUT\r\nNOT FALSIFICATIONISM\r\nFalsificationism has been argued to be inextricably bound to induction. The\r\nmerits of falsificationism were even shown to be justifiable by the fact that it\r\ncan ultimately lead to strong verifications. In general, the less probable of the\r\ntwo possible outcomes will tell us most about the “truth” of a hypothesis.\r\nThis relation is specified in Popper’s severity of test function. The core of\r\nfalsificationism, however, is its normative component: the hypothesis tester\r\nshould choose the test that will most probably lead to a falsification: she\r\nshould maximize the severity of the test selected to test her theory. How-\r\never, the normative aspect is not adequate as an empirical model, for both\r\ntheoretical and practical reasons. I will argue, however, that the formal\r\naspect, i.e., the relation between test choice and the properties of its outcome\r\nas specified in the severity of test formula, provides a useful basis for\r\nmodelling hypothesis-testing behaviour. Next the problems of normative\r\nfalsificationism in practice are dealt with.\r\nGiven the relation between the a priori test properties and the actual test\r\nresults, hypothesis testing can be seen as the choice of one test among a\r\nTranslating Popper’s philosophy 341\r\n","uuid":"f9085bff-9d14-483f-b936-6b95e2bd079b"},"_type":"pdf","highlight":{"text":["You want to <em>test</em> your\r\nassumption that R is a good make for your purposes.","This relation is specified in Popper’s severity of <em>test</em> function.","to <em>test</em> her theory.","Given the relation between the a priori <em>test</em> properties and the actual <em>test</em>\r\nresults, hypothesis testing","can be seen as the choice of one <em>test</em> among a\r\nTranslating Popper’s philosophy 341"]}},{"_id":"vZqQMoIB__mz3Yx-kDti","_index":"distant_rl_history","_score":27.319267,"_source":{"citeKey":"TapReinforcement69","created":1386566628000,"fileName":"[R] [[TapReinforcement69]] TappJ - 1969 - Reinforcement and Behavior.pdf","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[TapReinforcement69]] TappJ - 1969 - Reinforcement and Behavior.pdf","modified":1656978497000,"pageIndex":195,"pages":437,"text":"188 D.

Terman’s assumption that certain ethnic groups were \r\nnaturally more intelligent realized Binet’s fear that intelligence tests would be \r\nused to label children and limit their opportunities. William Stern contributed the \r\nconcept of the IQ (intelligence quotient). The most widely used intelligence tests \r\ntoday are the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) and Wechsler’s tests for chil-\r\ndren. These tests differ from their predecessors in the way they offer an overall \r\nintelligence score as well as scores for various verbal and performance areas.\r\n 9-18 What is a normal curve, and what does it mean to say that a test has been \r\nstandardized and is reliable and valid?\r\nThe distribution of test scores often forms a normal (bell-shaped) curve around \r\nthe central average score, with fewer and fewer scores at the extremes. Standard-\r\nization establishes a basis for meaningful score comparisons by giving a test to a \r\nrepresentative sample of future test-takers. Reliability is the extent to which a test \r\nyields consistent results (on two halves of the test, on alternative forms of the test, \r\nor when people are retested). Validity is the extent to which a test measures or \r\npredicts what it is supposed to. A test has content validity if it samples the perti-\r\nnent behavior (as a driving test measures driving ability). It has predictive validity \r\nif it predicts a behavior it was designed to predict. (Aptitude tests have predictive \r\nability if they can predict future achievements; their predictive power is best for \r\nthe early school years.)\r\n 9-19 How does aging affect crystallized and fl uid intelligence?\r\nCross-sectional studies (comparing people of different ages) and longitudinal \r\nstudies (retesting the same group over a period of years) have shown that fluid \r\nintelligence declines in older adults, in part because neural processing slows. \r\nHowever, crystallized intelligence tends to increase.\r\n 9-20 How stable are intelligence test scores over the life span?\r\nThe stability of intelligence test scores increases with age. At age 4, scores fluctu-\r\nate somewhat but begin to predict adolescent and adult scores. By early adoles-\r\ncence, scores are very stable and predictive.\r\n 9-21 What are the traits of those at the low and high intelligence extremes?\r\nAt the low extreme are those with unusually low scores. An intelligence test score \r\nof or below 70 is one diagnostic criterion for the diagnosis of intellectual disability; \r\nother criteria are limited conceptual, social, and practical skills. One condition \r\nincluded in this category is Down syndrome, a developmental disorder caused by \r\nan extra copy of chromosome 21. People at the high-intelligence extreme tend to \r\nbe healthy and well-adjusted, as well as unusually successful academically.\r\n Genetic and Environmental Infl uences on Intelligence\r\n 9-22 What evidence points to a genetic infl uence on intelligence, and what is \r\nheritability?\r\nStudies of twins, family members, and adoptees indicate a significant heredi-\r\ntary contribution to intelligence scores. Intelligence seems to be polygenetic, and \r\nresearchers are searching for genes that exert an influence. Heritability is the \r\nproportion of variation among individuals that can be attributed to genes.\r\n 9-23 What does evidence reveal about environmental infl uences on intelligence?\r\nStudies of twins, family members, and adoptees also provide evidence of environ-\r\nmental influences.

Following the deprivation period, the animals satis­\r\nfied their need state by eating or drinking, and this behavior was ex­\r\nhibited both during stimulation and during the interstimulus periods. \r\nAfter the animals had satiated themselves there was no tendency for \r\nany specific behavior to be elicited by hypothalamic stimulation. \r\nThese results were obtained in spite of the fact that the deprived ani­\r\nmals were stimulated when they were in a high drive state and while \r\nthey were engaged in the consummatory behavior necessary to reduce \r\nthe drive level. \r\nThe second test of the relevance of deprivation and natural drive \r\nstates used three animals that had exhibited more than one behavior \r\npattern in response to hypothalamic stimulation. The animals' (89S, \r\n61S, and 74S) elicited behavior record is listed in Table I. We at­\r\ntempted to make the behavior pattern that was exhibited least fre­\r\nquently in the competition test the dominant pattern. For example, if \r\nin the competition test more eating than drinking was exhibited, the \r\nanimal was deprived of water for the following 24 hours and then \r\ngiven a series of additional competition tests. The first of these tests \r\nwas administered simultaneously with the replacement of the water \r\n(or food). Therefore, during this first test the animals received lateral \r\nhypothalamic stimulation while in a high thirst or hunger drive state. \r\nIn spite of this, none of the animals exhibited any permanent shift in \r\nthe relative frequency of the two behaviors elicited by the stimulation \r\nduring competition tests. During the standard tests administered \r\nwhen the animal was in a high drive state, there were changes in the \r\nrelative frequency of the two behaviors exhibited during stimulation. \r\nAnimal 89S is a good example of the temporary, but not pernTanent, \r\nchange observed during a test when the animal had been deprived of \r\nwater for 24 hours. The first competition test was the routine test \r\ngiven to all animals in Experiment 1. The animal ate 16 times and \r\ndrank on four stimulus presentations (Table I ) . The second competi­\r\ntion test was given after 24 hours of water deprivation, and the animal \r\nate nine times and drank 12 times. Following this test, water was \r\nmade available to the animal ad libitum. The next standard test was \r\nadministered two hours later, and the last test was given after a further \r\nlapse of 18 hours. During the last test the animal ate 20 times and \r\ndrank only once in response to hypothalamic stimulation, clearly indi­\r\ncating that stimulus-bound drinking had not become the dominant \r\nbehavior as a result of the manipulation of drive state by deprivation. \r\n","uuid":"61ab0a0b-dea9-48c5-a221-9d7acf5f8b4c"},"_type":"pdf","highlight":{"text":["The second <em>test</em> of the relevance of deprivation and natural drive \r\nstates used three animals that had","Therefore, during this first <em>test</em> the animals received lateral \r\nhypothalamic stimulation while in a","The first competition <em>test</em> was the routine <em>test</em> \r\ngiven to all animals in Experiment 1.","Following this <em>test</em>, water was \r\nmade available to the animal ad libitum.","The next standard <em>test</em> was \r\nadministered two hours later, and the last <em>test</em> was given after a further"]}},{"_id":"8pqRMoIB__mz3Yx-tWTm","_index":"distant_rl_history","_score":27.224817,"_source":{"citeKey":"JMAge01","created":1649120962000,"fileName":"[R] [[JMAge01]] Judy Klein, Mary Morgan - 2001 - The age of economic measurement.pdf","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[JMAge01]] Judy Klein, Mary Morgan - 2001 - The age of economic measurement.pdf","modified":1649120962000,"pageIndex":346,"pages":416,"text":"Fisher's Instrumental Approach 337\r\na dual comparison and a multiple comparison were slight.

Fisher noted \r\nthat the Circular Test could be considered “at bottom, to be simply a tri­\r\nangular test\" (295), and if one takes a \"3-around\" comparison, the drawn \r\ntriangle was almost closed (see figure 4). “The lines return so nearly to \r\nthe starting point in each case that the observer has to look [very!] closely \r\nto see the gap” (287).

But in practice one would like to make a multiple \r\ncomparison between countries or times.

As an empirical test \r\nrather than a theoretical requirement, the \"triangular test\" is analogous \r\nto the measurement of the sum of angles to find the properties of a space. \r\nIt can be used to observe the properties of the index number space.

A pale yellow test patch\r\nagainst blue becomes more saturated for the same reasons. Since density of\r\nlateral connections decreases with distance, it can be predicted that con-\r\ntrast effects will be ( i ) greatest about the margins of large test patches,\r\n(2) greater for small as compared with large test patches, and (3) decrease\r\nwith the distance between test and inducing areas. All of these phenomena\r\nare well known.\r\nRelations between contrast and contour processes also give rise to certain\r\neffects. We have seen that one of the characteristics of contours is that\r\nthey prevent activity from spreading in the visual system. This is irrelevant\r\nas far as simple brightness contrast is concerned, since the same stimulus\r\nproperties give rise to both phenomena. (Indeed, the lateral inhibition of\r\none contour upon a neighboring one is probably nothing other than the\r\ninhibition between like processes of unequal intensity which underlies con-\r\ntrast.) But this limiting effect of contours is highly significant with respect\r\nto color contrast. Since the contrast phenomenon depends upon lateral in-\r\nteractions, any barrier between test and inducing regions will minimize it.\r\nSince, as we have seen, brightness differences between adjacent regions set\r\nup contours, it follows that color contrast should be diminished to the\r\nextent that there are brightness differences between test and inducing\r\nregions. This is decidedly the case—the most vivid color contrasts are ob-\r\ntained when total brightness is equal for test and inducing regions. A com-\r\nmon trick to enhance contrast is to cover both regions with thin tissue\r\npaper ; this makes the contour between test and inducing regions less abrupt.\r\nThese hypotheses also predict a phenomenon that, to this writer's knowl-\r\nedge, has not been reported previously. Just as both brightness summation\r\nand brightness inhibition have been demonstrated, so color summation, as\r\nwell as color contrast, should be observable under appropriate conditions.\r\nWhat are these conditions? In theory, all that is required is the excitation\r\nof a particular quality greater in the test region than in the inducing region,\r\nbut this is difficult to accomplish in practice. The fact that an inducing area\r\nhas a given dominant hue means that, relative to other components, this\r\ncomponent has a high excitation rate. How are we to give this component\r\na faster rate in the test patch? If we use a deeply saturated and dark blue\r\nfor the inducing area and a bright white for the test patch, it is probable\r\nthat the rate of fire for the blue mechanisms in the bright white patch will\r\nactually be more rapid than in the blue surround, even though the test\r\npatch appears white because of equal excitation of other mechanisms. Theo-\r\nretically, the blue in the surround should summate with the blue in the\r\ntest patch to give a bluish tinge to the central patch. But if the test patch\r\nis a sharply cut white circle, the effect is very slight. Why? Because the\r\nover-all brightness difference between bright patch and dark ground sets\r\nup a strong contour which inhibits lateral effects. The writer has found,\r\nhowever, that a definite bluing (or pinking, or greening, depending on the\r\nhue of the dark inducing area) can be obtained under these conditions /'/ the\r\nabruptness of the contour is broken dozen by using an irregular test patch\r\nwith fuzzy edges.

There are two reasons why\r\nall the gross gain may not be realized. First, the similarity test is only a\r\nheuristic. It offers no guarantee that it will let through only expressions\r\nthat will subsequently match. The similarity test also offers no guarantee\r\nthat it will not reject expressions that would match if attempted. The\r\nsimilarity test does not often commit this type of error (corresponding to\r\na type II statistical error), as will be shown later. However, even rare\r\noccurrences of such errors can be costly. One example occurs in theproof\r\nof theorem 2.07:\r\ni 1\r\n' I;\r\n!\r\n[\r\nM\r\nr\r\nIi'<]<'\r\nr\r\np implies (p or p).

LT discovers\r\nthe proof through chaining forward, where it checks for a direct match\r\nbefore creating the new subproblem, but the proof is about five times as\r\nexpensive as when the similarity test is omitted.\r\nThe second reason why the gross gain will not all be realized is that the\r\nsimilarity test is not costless, and in fact for those theorems which pass\r\nthe test the cost of the similarity test must be paid in addition to the cost\r\nof the matching.

The process of \r\nestablishing that a given test is valid is called “validation”. It is commonly contrasted \r\nwith the notion of “reliability”. Both of these concepts pertain to the “goodness” of a \r\npsychological measurement or detection procedure. For example, a particular testing \r\nprocedure is reliable if its results can be replicated under similar circumstances, whereas\r\nfnit is valid if it really measures what it is thought to measure.

The x axis for an item curve (see Fig. 5) Is the raw score,\r\na manifest piece of information; for a trace line the x axis is a con-\r\nstruct, the latent continuum (see Fig. 8).\r\nThe consequences of this difference can be seen easily in the case\r\nof a one-dimensional test. Within the framework of test theory we have\r\nto assume in advance that the test items are indicators of a one-dimen-\r\nsional continuum. This continuum is roughly approximated by the\r\nraw score, and the shape of the empirical item curve is then used to\r\nselect items.

This., however, is by\r\nno means true for all one-dimensional models. In the case of the latent\r\ncontent model, for example, one-dimensionality requires the matrix of\r\nthe reciprocals l/[ij] of the cross products have rank two. 15 Such tests\r\nare, of course, only special cases of what in section III, step 3, were\r\ndiscussed as conditions of reducibility.\r\nThe reader should keep in mind the difference between this com-\r\nparison with test theory and the earlier comparison with factor\r\nanalysis.

The amended neo-Turing Test con-\r\n ception attempts to avoid the problem I have posed by placing a\r\n condition on the internal processing (albeit a minimal one), viz., that\r\n it not be explosive. So the amended neo-Turing Test conception\r\n does characterize intelligence partly with respect to its internal\r\n etiology, and hence the amended neo-Turing Test conception\r\n is psychologistic.\r\n While the amended neo-Turing Test conception is an im-\r\n provement over the original neo-Turing Test conception in this\r\n one respect (it appeals to internal processing), it suffers from a\r\n variety of defects. One difficulty arises because there is an am-\r\n biguity in phrases such as \"averts the exponential explosion of\r\n search.\" Such phrases can be understood as equivalent to \"avoids\r\n exponential explosion altogether\" (i.e., uses methods that do not\r\n require computational resources that go up exponentially with\r\n the \"length\" of the task) or, alternatively, as \"postpones exponen-\r\n tial explosion long enough\" (i.e., does use methods that require\r\n computational resources that go up exponentially with the\r\n \"length\" of the task, but the \"length\" of the task is short enough\r\n that the required resources are in fact available).

It consists of 100 jokes, each of which the subject is\r\nasked to consider separately and to rate on the basis of quality.\r\nIn addition to this quality judgment, the subjects are asked to\r\nclassify each joke as belonging to some particular category of\r\nhumor.

To avoid unwar-\r\nranted inferences, I will go for an operational notion of intelligence.\r\nCaution-driven operationalism utilizes (at least) two Carnapian principles: iteration \r\nand the idea that human judgment and pushback from reality are intertwined in the \r\nprocess of concept formation. To see this, consider how the revision of a concept of \r\nintelligence might go. The first revisions will likely be based on things like correlations \r\nbetween tests, stability of test results over time, and other such “operation-level” prop-\r\nerties, that is, properties that do not in and of themselves say very much about what \r\nkind of test-independent attribute determines test results.9 But revision of the measure \r\nin light of evidence of stability and correlations between tests might help researchers \r\nzoom in on that determinant in the long run. This is because one explanation of why \r\ntest results are stable over time is that the test captures the same test-independent attrib-\r\nute on each administration. Likewise, one explanation of why two tests correlate is that \r\nthey measure the same attribute. If researchers are lucky, the triangulation of various \r\ntypes of evidence, and revision of the measure in light of that evidence, might pro-\r\nduce knowledge about the nature of the determinant of test-responses (on triangulation, \r\nsee e.g. Kuorikoski & Marchionni, 2016). Through these iterative steps, then, scientists \r\nmight gradually gain enough confidence to make the step from a cautious operational \r\nconcept to a bold non-operational concept.\r\nIt is not a novel idea that validation can help researchers zoom in on what exactly \r\na test measures. My aim here is just to give an interpretation of these standard valida-\r\ntion activities in terms of conceptual engineering, and to thereby formulate a version \r\nof operationalism that is not doomed to antirealism. Vis-à-vis antirealism, the point of \r\nthe above (admittedly oversimplified) depiction of operationalist conceptual engineer-\r\ning is this. In this process, every conceptual revision—that is, every Carnapian epis-\r\ntemic iteration—whether it is from an operational concept to another operational one or \r\nfrom an operational concept to a non-operational one, involves a combination of human \r\njudgment and empirical evidence that testifies for reality. When doing the operational-\r\nto-operational-move, a researcher may well admit that test-independent properties exist \r\nand that they exert an influence on the way their measure behaves. But she chooses not \r\nto formulate her concept in terms of test-independent properties, because she judges \r\nthat the evidence is not sufficient to warrant claims about what the relevant test-inde-\r\npendent properties are like. Test-independent reality does push back, but the researcher \r\nchooses to not describe that reality when characterizing her target concept. This kind of \r\ncaution-driven operationalism is perfectly compatible with realism and may indeed end \r\nup morphing into non-operational measurement in the long run.\r\nThese points about epistemic iteration are meant to illustrate that operationalists can \r\naccept the existence and possibility of epistemic access to test-independent entities, \r\nand hence need not be anti-realists.

While such criteria appear to provide purchase on the nature of \r\nintelligence, they fail miserably. \r\nThe failure to develop a consensual definition of intelligence was exacerbated by \r\nincreasing concerns within the discipline about its status as a science. In its movement \r\ntoward professionalization psychologists “became increasingly concrned with their reputa- \r\ntion as a science.”39 Frustrated by the presence of widespread differences within the \r\ndiscipline there was a continual search for scientific legitimacy and considerable debate \r\nabout method.40 The inability to define intelligence was not congenial to the desire for \r\nscientific legitimacy and prompted considerable activity trying to resolve the issue. \r\nThe Emergence of Validity \r\nEventually the methodology surrounding tests was refined and translated into a \r\nspecific paradigm. Spurred on by the acceptance of the Pearson product-moment cor- \r\nrelation as a means of assessing the degree of covariation between two variables, studies \r\nbegan to emerge which promised an empirical solution to the definitional problem. The \r\nprototypical study involved administering a mental test (for example, the Stanford-Binet) \r\nto a group of subjects in addition to gathering several other measurements (for exam- \r\nple, teacher ratings of a child’s “intelligence”) which, for ease of communication, will \r\nbe labeled criterion variables. The analysis involved calculating a correlation between \r\nthe test and criterion scores. A high correlation was interpreted as indicating that the \r\ntest was measuring the same thing as the criterion (for example, the Stanford-Binet was \r\nmeasuring the same thing as the teacher ratings if the test-criterion correlation was high). \r\nThe accumulation of a sufficient number of high correlations would allow one to infer \r\nthe nature of exactly what the test was measuring. This method was elegant in its sim- \r\nplicity, and very comforting to researchers because of its recourse to empirical data as \r\nthe determiner of what the test was measuring. \r\nBy the 1920s the literature was full of studies exploring mental testing using this \r\nmethod. Sophisticated extensions of the Pearson product-moment correlation emerged \r\n(for example, partial correlation) and a very vigorous research tradition ensued. Tests \r\ndemonstrating high correlations with proper criteria were described as being trust- \r\nIn a 1914 study introducing a picture completion test, W. Healy made reference \r\nto the “establishment of the validity” of his test - which is the first reference I’ve been \r\nable to locate which applied the word validity to this methodological appr~ach.~’ Sidney \r\nPressey published an article in 1920 on validity in which the word “validity” was always \r\npresented in quotes, suggesting that it had not yet gained consensus in the field.43 In \r\n1927 E. B. Skaggs indicated that “the term ‘test validity’ has now come to signify the \r\ndegree to which any test actually tests that which it was designed to test, and nothing \r\nelse” providing evidence that the term had, by 1927, emerged as critical to the emerging \r\ntheory of psychological measurement .44 \r\nFrom 1927 the term validity came to occupy a central position in discussions of \r\npsychological measurement.

(Frisch 1930, \r\n400). While Fisher's approach was to select among a number of index \r\nformulae by testing them, Frisch's method was to derive mathematically \r\nthe appropriate form from these tests. By interpreting the tests as con­\r\nditions on the functional form of the index number formula, Frisch was \r\nable to derive the unique index number formula satisfying the Commen­\r\nsurability Test (F8), the Circular Test (F7-C), and the Factor Reversal \r\nTest (F9). In addition, however, Frisch showed that the Base Test (F7) \r\n(or Circular Test, F7-C), the Commensurability Test (F8), and the De­\r\nterminateness Tests (F3 and F4) could not all be fulfilled at the same \r\ntime-they were \"incompatible?5 So, according to Frisch, one has to se­\r\nlect between the tests. Since he favored a chain index, the Circular Test \r\nwas not questioned. The choice then lay between satisfying the Determi­\r\nnateness Tests and the Commensurability Test, and Frisch chose in favor \r\nof the Determinateness Tests.\r\n10. Diewert (1998) distinguishes four main approaches to index number theory: (1) statisti­\r\ncal (2) test or axiomatic; (3) microeconomic, which relies on the assumption of maximizing or \r\nminimizing behavior; and (4) neostatistical. Note that Diewert equates the test and axiomatic \r\napproach, whereas in this essay they are treated separately.\r\nTo better understand Frisch's critique of Fisher's tests, one should first \r\nnote that Frisch advocated the microeconomic approach based on indi­\r\nvidual choice theory (see Spencer Banzhaf's article in this volume).10 In \r\nhis survey on index numbers, Frisch (1936) developed a theory of price \r\nindexes from the viewpoint of utility theory; that is, the price index is the \r\nratio of costs of achieving a given utility level in two situations so the re­\r\nsult is a function of the utility level.

He hypothesized that the human brain is a digital \r\ncomputer and he believed that ‘machines can be constructed which will simulate the behaviour \r\nof the human mind very closely’.16 In the 1950s it was said that ‘Turing and others have tried \r\nto deine thought processes in terms of formal machine states or logic’.17 Taking this view, a \r\ncomputer’s success in the imitation game is an indication that its processing resembles human \r\nthinking.\r\nhe diiculty for both these readings is Turing’s own words: when he spoke explicitly about \r\nthe concept of intelligence, he did not reduce intelligence either to behaviour or to computa-\r\ntion.18 On the contrary, when introducing the 1948 chess-playing version of the game, he said \r\nthat the concept of intelligence is an ‘emotional concept’ and he spoke of the temptation to \r\n‘imagine intelligence’ in a machine.19 Emotional concepts are those concepts—such as beauty, \r\ncolour, and goodness—that we frequently say are ‘in the eye of the beholder’. If a painting looks \r\nbeautiful (to normal people in normal conditions), it is beautiful. Turing said that whether or \r\nnot an entity is intelligent depends in part on our reaction to it; our imagining intelligence in \r\nanother entity is crucial to that entity’s being intelligent. Taking this third view of the imitation \r\ngame, the game tests whether the interrogator will imagine intelligence in a machine contestant.\r\nFor more on these three interpretations of the Turing test, see Chapter 28.\r\nNew games\r\nhe Turing test has been—and surely will continue to be—modiied, extended, diluted, and \r\ntransformed. his indicates its importance to the ield of AI.\r\nSome theorists think that it is impossible to have a disembodied thinking thing, and so they \r\npropose the ‘total’ (or ‘robotic’) Turing test, in which a machine ‘must be able to do, in the real \r\nworld of objects and people, everything that real people can do, in a way that is indistinguishable \r\n(to a person) from the way real people do it’.20 In an even harder version of this test—the ‘truly \r\ntotal’ Turing test—a system of these machines must be capable of generating human abilities \r\nby themselves. Other theorists focus on how intelligence develops. In the ‘toddler’ Turing test \r\na machine must answer questions exactly as a 3-year old human would. (In yet another test, a \r\nmachine can think if it can rear a child!) Some proposed tests limit the interrogator’s questions: \r\nin the ‘Feigenbaum test’ an expert judge must distinguish a computer expert from a human \r\nexpert in a speciic ield, and in the ‘tutoring test’ a machine contestant must teach as efectively \r\nas a human tutor. Many of what are now called ‘Turing-style’ tests depart from Turing’s format. \r\nIn the ‘Pleming test’, for example, two identical machine contestants communicate with each \r\nother, passively observed by a human judge; if this interaction looks like human communica-\r\ntion, and even better shows signs of creativity, the machines can think. (his is a ‘ly on the wall’ \r\nor third-person Turing test.)\r\nFor Turing the imitation game is a criterion for thinking, whereas later theorists have pre-\r\nsented it as measuring other abilities, including free will. In the ‘Lovelace test’ a machine is \r\ngenuinely creative if its designer cannot explain the machine’s behaviour in terms of its design \r\nand knowledge store—only machines with an element of mystery pass this test.

The present discus¬ \r\nsion suggests that the options with respect \r\nto design are quite limited. When the effects \r\nof prior training on new learning are under \r\nstudy, the same test task must be used under \r\nthe experimental and the control treatment. \r\nThere may, of course, be a number of different \r\nexperimental treatments; the requirement of \r\na common test task obtains with equal force \r\nin such cases. There are circumstances in \r\nwhich the characteristics of the materials, for \r\nexample, the associative relations between \r\nitems in successive lists, make it expedient to \r\nuse different test tasks. If that is done, the \r\ntasks must be shown to be strictly equivalent \r\nin difficulty, so that the test-stage require¬ \r\nments may be assumed to be the same under \r\nall conditions. Thus, most acceptable designs \r\nreduce to the basic format illustrated by the \r\ncomparisons of AB with XB, and AB with NB. \r\nWhen interest centers on improvement in an \r\nexisting ability, the use of pretests is necessi¬ \r\ntated. These tests must, of course, be equiva¬ \r\nlent and the same under all treatments. \r\nMEASUREMENT OF TRANSFER \r\nLet us return to the basic design in which \r\nthe sequence of events is AB under the ex¬ \r\nperimental treatment and XB under the control \r\ntreatment. The direction and amount of \r\ntransfer are measured by the difference in \r\nperformance between the two groups on the \r\ncommon test task B. Transfer can be measured \r\nat any or all points in test-task learning for \r\nwhich data are available. As a practical matter \r\nit is advisable to carry practice on the test task \r\nto a high performance criterion or for a sub¬ \r\nstantial number of trials. It is then possible to \r\ndetermine both the initial level of facilitation „ \r\nor interference and the changes in transfer \r\neffects that develop in the course of acquisi¬ \r\ntion. \r\nThere are a priori reasons for expecting \r\nmeasures taken early in test-task learning to \r\nbe maximally sensitive to transfer effects. The \r\ndifference in prior experience between the \r\nexperimental and the control group is greatest \r\nat the beginning of the second stage. The two \r\ngroups are treated alike during the acquisition \r\nof the test task, and the relative weight of \r\nthe earlier training will diminish as test learn¬ \r\ning continues. It must be recognized, how¬ \r\never, that much will depend on the com¬ \r\nponents of performance that are carried over \r\nfrom the training to the test phase. If the \r\npreviously acquired habits first come into play \r\nrelatively late in the acquisition of the test \r\ntas(<, the manifestation of significant transfer \r\neffects will be correspondingly delayed. In \r\nsome cases prior training is a source of both \r\nfacilitation and interference, and the oppos¬ \r\ning influences may come to the fore at differ¬ \r\nent points in the acquisition process, so that \r\nthe sign of the transfer effects changes in the \r\ncourse of test-task learning. It is clear that \r\nthere can be no general rules specifying the \r\npoints in test-task learning that should be \r\nconsidered in the determination of transfer \r\neffects. Nevertheless the likely importance of \r\nmeasures obtained early in acquisition is \r\nworth emphasizing, especially in view of \r\nthe fact that there is sometimes an undue \r\nreliance on criterial measures. For example, \r\nin verbal learning a criterion of mastery not \r\nonly represents a chance peak in a fluctuating \r\ncurve of performance (Melton, 1936), but the \r\ntime required to attain it also depends heavily \r\non the speed of acquisition of the most \r\ndifficult item in the list.

Worse, the deinitions these ‘essence’ theorists \r\nofer are behaviourist: ‘general’ intelligence, they say, is the ability to achieve goals, produce \r\nsyntactically complex utterances, or answer highly complex questions. However, even if such \r\nan ability is enough for intelligence, is it enough for thinking?\r\nSeveral critics of the Turing test say that, even if human-level AI is a suitable target for \r\nresearchers, the test doesn’t help us to get there: the task of building a machine that an inter-\r\nrogator will misidentify as human is too diicult. Indeed, it has been claimed that ‘the Turing \r\nTest could be passed only by things that have experienced the world as we [humans] have’—\r\nalthough this claim was withdrawn in the face of modern computer methods of analysing \r\nextraordinarily large amounts of data.30 However, many people raise this objection only \r\nbecause they confuse the goal of human-level AI with much-hyped but unsuccessful strategies \r\ntaken to get there—such as Good Old Fashioned AI, which focused on ‘symbol systems’ with \r\na huge store of knowledge. Turing himself suggested another route: build and educate a ‘child \r\nmachine’ (see Chapter 30). his involves giving a machine a range of abilities, each of which \r\ncould be individually tested and incrementally improved—thus providing a route to human-\r\nlevel AI.\r\nCritics also complain that the Turing test is too easy, arguing that there is ‘no plausible devel-\r\nopmental pathway from increasing chatterbot performance in the Turing test to genuine artii-\r\ncial intelligence’. On this view, the test merely encourages a programmer to use cheap tricks in \r\norder to fool a judge, who may be convinced just because he/she is especially gullible. Critics \r\nsay that the test aims at ‘artiicial stupidity’ rather than artiicial intelligence, since the machine \r\ncontestant must hide its superhuman capacities (such as perfect typing skills).31 However, the \r\nTuring test is not easy; many people make this complaint only because they confuse the simple \r\nprogramming strategies behind Loebner Contest chatbots with those necessary to succeed in \r\nTuring’s much harder game. It is true that individual interrogators might be gullible, or simply \r\nhave a bad day, but this shows only that the test is not a one-of test: to obtain a convincing \r\nresult, the game must be played several times.32 Also, the ‘artiicial stupidity’ objection is mis-\r\nguided, since disguising the machine is an unavoidable corollary rather than the aim of the test. \r\nTuring said that a machine should not be punished for disabilities, such as an ‘inability to shine \r\nin beauty competitions’, that are ‘irrelevant’ to whether the machine can think.33 To avoid this, \r\nthe machine’s appearance is hidden. A machine’s ‘deadly accuracy’ at typing or mathematics is \r\nan irrelevant ability and so must also be disguised.\r\nYet another criticism stems simply from the fact that the Turing test is a test. It is not a test \r\nof intelligence that we need, some critics say, it is a (computational) theory of intelligence. his, \r\nhowever, assumes that such a theory is possible—and if intelligence is an emotional concept \r\nthen such a theory is not possible.\r\nhe remaining complaint is that machines passing the Turing test would be of no practi-\r\ncal use; they would be ‘intellectual statues’, critics say—more expensive but no smarter than \r\nhuman labour. What we need instead, critics argue, are ‘intelligence ampliiers’—systems such \r\nas Google and Siri, and even driverless cars.34 his is to abandon AI’s grand goal of human-level \r\nAI in favour of ‘narrow’ goals. his stance seems unduly negative, however: machines with the \r\n","uuid":"970940d2-80d1-4bb3-977c-eb54cc63f5a7"},"_type":"pdf","highlight":{"text":[", the <em>test</em> doesn’t help us to get there: the task of building a machine that an inter-\r\nrogator will","Indeed, it has been claimed that ‘the Turing \r\n<em>Test</em> could be passed only by things that have experienced","On this view, the <em>test</em> merely encourages a programmer to use cheap tricks in \r\norder to fool a judge,","is not a one-of <em>test</em>: to obtain a convincing \r\nresult, the game must be played several times.32 Also","Yet another criticism stems simply from the fact that the Turing <em>test</em> is a <em>test</em>."]}},{"_id":"NZqPMoIB__mz3Yx-2SDK","_index":"distant_rl_history","_score":26.940397,"_source":{"citeKey":"ManPsychology04","created":1117115218000,"fileName":"[R] [[ManPsychology04]] ManktelowK - 2004 - Psychology of Reasoning - Theoretical and Historical Perspectives.pdf","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[ManPsychology04]] ManktelowK - 2004 - Psychology of Reasoning - Theoretical and Historical Perspectives.pdf","modified":1658012496000,"pageIndex":349,"pages":393,"text":"and therefore, being forced to reject the hypothesis.

In the degree of confirmation function, the accent lies on the potential\r\nof evidence e to increase our belief in the hypothesis H, after it is observed.\r\nSo, the severity function thus provides a pre-test perspective and the\r\ndegree of confirmation a post-test perspective. Severity refers to behaviour in\r\nchoosing the test; degree of confirmation refers to the induction following\r\nthe test. Popper’s philosophy is oriented on the pre-test phase, and explicitly\r\nnot on the second. Verificationists deal with the second phase. But, severity\r\nand degree of “corroboration” (“confirmation”) being fully equivalent,\r\nmaximizing one function necessarily leads to maximizing the other (Poletiek,\r\n2001).\r\nThere is also a non-formal version of the argument that falsificationism\r\ncannot do without induction that can be made. This can be illustrated\r\nby examining the characteristics of one of the most prototypical cases of\r\nfalsification testing: the famous Michelson and Morley finding about the\r\nvelocity of light, that corroborated Einstein’s relativity theory. Other\r\nexamples have the same characteristics, however. The prediction chosen to\r\ntest the theory was highly unlikely given the relevant background knowledge\r\navailable at that point. The Michelson–Morley finding was a clear case of\r\ntesting relativity theory the falsificationist way, because this finding was\r\nhighly unexpected a priori, and therefore the test could be expected before-\r\nhand to falsify the theory predicting it.\r\nThe first characteristic of this successful example of a falsifying test is that\r\nit seems to provide a better proof for a hypothesis because the predictions\r\ntested are so surprising a priori. This is intuitive: if Michelson and Morley’s\r\nfinding had not been so unexpected, it would have been felt as constituting\r\nless of a strong case for Einstein’s relativity theory. The surprisingness of an\r\neventually supporting piece of evidence is represented in the denominator\r\nof Popper’s definition of test severity (1). The second characteristic of this\r\nand other exemplary cases of falsificationism is that the falsification did not\r\nactually come about. Thus, the Michelson–Morley experiment did produce\r\nthe observation predicted by relativity theory, however unexpected before-\r\nhand. Thus, the falsifying test, although expected to produce a result that was\r\nconsistent with the available background knowledge and inconsistent with\r\nthe theory to be tested, surprisingly produced the unexpected result. In other\r\nwords, one of the great examples of falsificationism in science actually failed\r\nto do what it was supposed to do, namely to falsify the theory at test. This\r\nseems true for all such examples: the stories always end up with a fortunate\r\nconfirmation.\r\nThis last characteristic of the success of testing by falsification is less trivial\r\nthan it might look at first sight. It is quite striking for two reasons. The\r\nfirst reason is that these examples cannot but reflect the exceptional cases\r\nout of the total history of good falsifying hypothesis testing.

The average faculty estimate of her\r\nability placed her very near the bottom . It was 1.67 on a scale\r\nof ten. The faculty estimate, made after three months' ac\r\nquaintance with tne student, agrees with the psychological test\r\nmade on the day of entrance.\r\n“ The mental profile of another student, instead of running\r\nnear the bottom of the chart is almost entirely in the upper\r\nhalf, showing instantly that in nearly all the tests she excels the\r\nmajority of her classmates. She is, as a matter of fact, a good\r\nstudent, the faculty estimate on her ability being 9.8 on a\r\nscale of 10.\r\n","uuid":"9e5e9bc6-19a5-4e32-8891-4e82bf8b2232"},"_type":"pdf","highlight":{"text":["174 ARMY MENTAL TESTS\r\n66\r\ning are given to a large group of students, and the results for\r\neach <em>test</em>","In the\r\nnumber-completion <em>test</em>, for example, the scores made by the\r\nstudents are plotted against the","Know\r\ning his score in the <em>test</em>, one can say instantly, by reference to\r\nthe chart, that this student","“ The next stage is to compare these <em>test</em> rankings with\r\nscholarship records and with estimates of",", in the lowest 8% in the analogies <em>test</em>, in the\r\nlowest 5% in the completion <em>test</em>, and so on."]}},{"_id":"qJmKMoIB__mz3Yx-h05v","_index":"distant_rl_history","_score":26.93875,"_source":{"citeKey":"YerDancing07","created":null,"fileName":"[R] [[YerDancing07]] YerkesR - 1907 - Dancing Mouse.pdf","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[YerDancing07]] YerkesR - 1907 - Dancing Mouse.pdf","modified":1656789130000,"pageIndex":279,"pages":331,"text":"The Efficiency of Training Methods 249\r\nthey profited much more quickly by this method than by\r\nthe ten-test method, whereas just the reverse is true of the\r\nmales .

Whereas Cattell’s anthropometric mental tests \r\nhad failed to correlate with performance in school as measured by grades, \r\nBinet’s test did. And, no doubt to Goddard’s pleasure, the Binet test proved \r\nsuccessful in use with feebleminded children and indicated differences in \r\nperformance among those children. Goddard coined the term “moron” to \r\nlabel the highest group of feebleminded individuals (the terms “idiot” and \r\n“imbecile” already existed to describe lower-functioning individuals, with \r\n“idiot” being the lowest). The Binet test proved to be especially helpful in \r\ndifferentiating “morons” from persons of normal intelligence.26\r\nThere would be other versions of the Binet test in America, including \r\nthe 1916 version by Lewis Terman (1877–1956) of Stanford University \r\nthat, as the Stanford-Binet, became the dominant instrument for assessing \r\nintelligence in America over the next 40 years.

Fisher evaluates\r\nin a systematic manner a very large number of indices with respect to a number\r\nof criteria. These criteria are called ‘tests’. Fisher himself didn’t expect that it\r\nwould be possible to devise an index number that would satisfy all of these tests.\r\nMoreover, Frisch [1930] proves the impossibility of maintaining a certain set of\r\nFisher’s tests simultaneously. It is, however, Eichhorn ([1973; 1976], [1976], co-\r\nauthored with Voeller), who provides a definite evaluation of Fisher’s tests by his\r\naxiomatic approach.\r\nThe axiomatic approach should be distinguished from two other index theories.\r\nWithin the axiomatic theory prices and quantities of commodities are considered\r\nas separate variables. There is no assumption made concerning an underlying\r\noptimizing behavior, which is central to the microeconomic theory of price and\r\nquantity indices. Secondly, price and quantity changes of commodities do not\r\noriginate from an underlying probability distribution, characteristic for the statis-\r\ntical theory of indices.\r\nEichhorn looks systematically at the inconsistencies between various tests (and\r\nhow to prove such inconsistencies) by means of the functional equation theory,\r\nin particular Aczél’s [1966] solution of Cauchy’s functional equations. Functional\r\nequation theory is transferred into index theory if the price index is defined as a\r\npositive function P (ps, xs, pt, xt) that satisfies a number of axioms, where p is a\r\nprice vector and x a commodity vector, and the subscripts are time indices. These\r\naxioms do not, however, determine a unique form of the price index function.\r\nSeveral additional tests are needed for assessing the quality of a potential price\r\nindex. Both axioms and tests are formalized as functional equations.\r\nFrisch [1930] discusses the following seven tests:\r\n1. Identity test: P (ps, xs, ps, xt) = 1\r\n2. Time reversal test P (ps, xs, pt, xt)× P (pt, xt, ps, xs) = 1\r\n3. Base test: P (ps,xs,pu,xu)\r\nP (ps,xs,pt,xt)\r\n= P (pv,xv,pu,xu)\r\nP (pv,xv,pt,xt)\r\n4. Circular test: P (ps, xs, pt, xt)× P (pt, xt, pu, xu) = P (ps, xs, pu, xu)\r\n5. Commensurability test: P (λps, xs/λ, λpt, xt/λ) =P (ps, xs, pt, xt)\r\n6. Determinateness test: The index number shall not be rendered zero, infinite,\r\nor indeterminate by an individual price or quantity becoming zero.\r\n7. Factor reversal test: P (ps, xs, pt, xt)× P (xs, ps, xt, pt) = pt · xt/ps · xs\r\nNote, that when assuming the identity test (1) the time reversal test (2) follows\r\nfrom the circular test (4), which in its turn follows from the base test. This can be\r\nseen by first substituting t for v, which gives (4), and subsequently s for u, which\r\ngives (2).\r\nFrisch’s approach is to consider these tests as conditions on the functional form\r\nP of the index formula, and then to derive mathematically the general forms\r\n","uuid":"898ce428-0203-497e-b070-d533fe0cef23"},"_type":"pdf","highlight":{"text":["Identity <em>test</em>: P (ps, xs, ps, xt) = 1\r\n2.","Time reversal <em>test</em> P (ps, xs, pt, xt)× P (pt, xt, ps, xs) = 1\r\n3.","Commensurability <em>test</em>: P (λps, xs/λ, λpt, xt/λ) =P (ps, xs, pt, xt)\r\n6.","the identity <em>test</em> (1) the time reversal <em>test</em> (2) follows\r\nfrom the circular <em>test</em> (4), which in its turn","follows from the base <em>test</em>."]}},{"_id":"O5qPMoIB__mz3Yx-2SDZ","_index":"distant_rl_history","_score":26.800404,"_source":{"citeKey":"ManPsychology04","created":1117115218000,"fileName":"[R] [[ManPsychology04]] ManktelowK - 2004 - Psychology of Reasoning - Theoretical and Historical Perspectives.pdf","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[ManPsychology04]] ManktelowK - 2004 - Psychology of Reasoning - Theoretical and Historical Perspectives.pdf","modified":1658012496000,"pageIndex":355,"pages":393,"text":"confirmation theories, because good falsifying testing is choosing tests that\r\nnecessarily also satisfy good testing according to confirmation theories.\r\nThird, falsifying evidence actually becomes less informative the more it is the\r\nresult of a stricter falsificatory test choice. This paradox was argued to be\r\ninherent in the falsificatory theory. A falsificatory test is most fruitful when it\r\nunexpectedly results in a confirmation a posteriori. In other words, falsifi-\r\ncationism’s success results from its failure. Apart from these theoretical\r\nconsiderations, from a pragmatic point of view repeatedly observing falsify-\r\ning evidence is not the sure way to increase knowledge. It leads to a sequence\r\nof refutations, which repeatedly sets the tester back. The confirmatory\r\nalternative would involve a sequence of low-value confirmations slowly con-\r\nsolidating the theory. One might also follow a strategy somewhere in between.\r\nFor example, “binary search” involves testing first one half of the set of\r\nalternatives, then half of the set left over, et cetera, until the hypothesis is\r\nnarrowed down most closely to the true state of nature.\r\nFalsificationism is a proper model for modelling hypothesis-testing\r\nbehaviour, however, especially the severity of test measure.

But describing test\r\nchoice in these terms is no different from the confirmations model. The result\r\nof this “merger” of the two classical rival views on testing is a unified model\r\nthat can represent testing behaviour in a very intuitive way, as was shown\r\nabove, and it provides a good point of departure for the study of human\r\nhypothesis testing, both everyday and expert.\r\nThe criticism of the concept of confirmation bias does not imply that no\r\nerrors in actual testing behaviour can occur. For example, since the a priori\r\ntest choice dictates the value of the different posterior possible outcomes of a\r\ntest, the value of an actual test result may be under- or overestimated. For\r\nexample, if a test is chosen with a high probability of a supportive result,\r\nthis result, if actually found, should be seen as a weak proof of the truth of\r\nthe hypothesis. If, however, the hypothesis tester overestimates this probative\r\nvalue, then an unwarranted induction is made. Imagine that you would be\r\nabsolutely convinced that your R-car is the best choice after having heard this\r\nfrom an R-car dealer. The cost of such a reasoning error might be that you\r\npay too high a price for it. Slowiazcek, Klayman, Sherman, and Skov (1992)\r\nshowed that hypothesis testers tend to weigh the values of both severe and\r\nweak tests equally. This bias was found in experimental tasks in which the\r\nrelation between test properties prior to testing and the properties of the\r\noutcomes were not very intuitive due to the formal presentation of the\r\nstimuli. Nonetheless, this result indicates an important possible pitfall of\r\neveryday hypothesis testing. People may assign too much value to observa-\r\ntions from weak tests, as in the car example. Or, in contrast, people might\r\nunderestimate the value of a confirmation from a severe test. For example,\r\npeople convinced that they have a serious illness might underestimate the\r\nvalue of a medical test result that contradicts their idea, continuing to worry\r\nTranslating Popper’s philosophy 345\r\n","uuid":"e280afc8-caf5-4db7-a20f-0a06648a52fd"},"_type":"pdf","highlight":{"text":["A falsificatory <em>test</em> is most fruitful when it\r\nunexpectedly results in a confirmation a posteriori.","is a proper model for modelling hypothesis-testing\r\nbehaviour, however, especially the severity of <em>test</em>","But describing <em>test</em>\r\nchoice in these terms is no different from the confirmations model.","of a\r\n<em>test</em>, the value of an actual <em>test</em> result may be under- or overestimated.","Or, in contrast, people might\r\nunderestimate the value of a confirmation from a severe <em>test</em>."]}},{"_id":"oJqRMoIB__mz3Yx-S1dR","_index":"distant_rl_history","_score":26.800404,"_source":{"citeKey":"WalSequential45","created":1470492231000,"fileName":"[R] [[WalSequential45]] WaldA - 1945 - Sequential Tests of Statistical Hypotheses.pdf","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[WalSequential45]] WaldA - 1945 - Sequential Tests of Statistical Hypotheses.pdf","modified":1599779636000,"pageIndex":9,"pages":71,"text":" SEQUENTIAL TESTS 125\r\n current procedure can be considered as a sequential test defined as follows: For\r\n all m < N, the regions R?

The sequential process is terminated at the smallest value n\r\n of m for which the sample point lies either in R?n or in R'. If the sample point\r\n lies in R? we accept Ho and if it lies in R' we accept H1 .\r\n An indication as to the proper choice of the regions R?, RA and Rm can be\r\n obtained from the following considerations: Suppose that before the sample is\r\n drawn there exists an a priori probability that Ho is true and the value of this\r\n probability is known. Denote this a priori probability by go . Then the a priori\r\n probability that H1 is true is given by g9 = 1 - go, since it is assumed that the\r\n hypotheses Ho and H1 exhaust all possibilities. After a number of observations\r\n have been made we gain additional information which will affect the probability\r\n that Hi (i = 0, 1) is true. Let gom be the a posteriori probability that Ho is true\r\n and gim the a posteriori probability that H1 is true after m observations have been\r\n made.

Otherwise, no decision can be made; maybe it can fly, maybe it\r\ncannot (French, 1990).\r\nThe Seagull Test works as follows: There are two three-dimensional radar\r\nscreens, one tracking a seagull and the other tracking the flying object attempt-\r\ning the test. The object will pass the test only if it is indistinguishable from the\r\nseagull on the radar screen. The similarity between our TT and the Seagull Test is\r\nevident. The arguments about the essence of flying between the two philosophers\r\nare uncannily reminiscent of the arguments on the nature of intelligence. The test\r\nitself is an almost direct analogue of the TT.\r\nThe Seagull test as it is cannot be passed by airplanes, helicopters, bats, beetles,\r\nor sparrows. It is doubtful that anything can pass it. That is, except for the Nordic\r\nseagulls of the philosophers’ island. Then, ‘what we have is not a test for flight at\r\nall, but rather a test for flight as practiced by the Nordic Seagull’ (French, 1990,\r\np. 56). The analogy makes it clear what French thinks about the TT. Correspond-\r\ningly, he believes that the TT is a test for intelligence as practiced by a human\r\nbeing.\r\nBefore proceeding with his main arguments about subcognitive questions,\r\nFrench calls attention to several assumptions he is making. First, he allows the\r\ninterrogator to poll humans for the answers to some questions before asking them\r\nduring the test with the machine. Another assumption is that all the people involved\r\nare from the same culture and the machine is attempting to imitate an individual\r\nfrom that culture.22 And finally, French assumes that although building a machine\r\nthat can experience the world in a way indistinguishable from that of a human\r\nbeing (from tasting strawberries to falling off bikes) is theoretically possible, this\r\nis not likely to occur in the foreseeable future.\r\nThe first class of questions that French introduces are explicitly designed to\r\nreveal low-level cognitive structure. These are based on research in cognitive psy-\r\nchology, in particular, associative priming. For instance, it has been established that\r\nif human subjects are presented with a set of words and non-words, they generally\r\nrequire less time to recognize that a string is a word if it is preceded by a related\r\nword, rather than a non-related one or a non-word. To give a specific example, the\r\nitem \"salt\" should be recognized faster when preceded by \"pepper\" and not by an\r\nunrelated word like \"shoe\" or a non-word like \"gloff\".\r\nBefore questioning the computer, the interrogator runs a similar experiment on\r\na group of people23 and calculates average recognition times. During the test, the\r\ninterrogator can distinguish between the machine and the human simply by looking\r\nat the recognition times on the same set of words on which the experiment had\r\nbeen carried out. It is hard to imagine a machine being successful at deceiving the\r\ninterrogator in such a case. The only possible way to carry out associative priming\r\nin a manner that is similar to the average human’s seems to be having experienced\r\nlife as an average human.\r\nIt may seem unfair to expect computers to match scientific, experimental data\r\nabout subcognitive capacities of the human mind.

Because the economic significance of the factor reversal test is generally\r\nconsidered to be controversial, Eichhorn abandons this test. He then shows that\r\nthe other four are independent but still inconsistent.\r\nEichhorn [1976] discusses weaker versions of Fisher’s system of tests. It appears\r\nthat if one weakens only the circular test, by replacing it by the time reversal test,\r\nthen the system of five tests is consistent. To obtain consistency, one has to give\r\nup the economic meaningful circular test.\r\nEichhorn’s axiomatic approach, his ‘art of model building’ which he not only\r\napplied to index numbers but also to production functions, can be summarized as\r\nfollows:\r\n• formulate some important properties (P1, . . ., Pk, say) of the required func-\r\ntions,\r\n• prove their consistency by presenting a function that has all these properties,\r\n• show the independence of the properties\r\nThen, these properties (assumptions, hypotheses, premises, desiderata, axioms)\r\nconstitute a model [Stehling 1993].\r\n3 EMPIRICAL REPRESENTATIONAL THEORY OF MEASUREMENT\r\nAnderson [1981] mentions three limitations on the axiomatic approach. The first\r\nlimitation is that it leaves out the question of how the mathematical structures\r\ngain their empirical significance in actual practical measurement. Secondly, the\r\naxiomatic approach lacks concrete measurement procedures, devices and methods.\r\nThe representation theorem is non-constructive. Although the theorem may im-\r\nply that a scale exists, it does not provide any way to get it. And thirdly, the\r\naxiomatic approach applies only to error-free data; it says nothing about handling\r\nthe response variability in real data.\r\nInfluenced by the program of axiomatization, launched by Hilbert, axiomatiza-\r\ntion is considered to put theories — and thereby measurement — on firm founda-\r\ntions, an ambition that is explicitly indicated by the title of Krantz, Luce, Suppes\r\nand Tversky’s three-volume survey. An apparent representative of this position is\r\nRoberts [1979, 3] by stating: ‘We are not interested in a measuring apparatus and\r\nin the interaction between the apparatus and the objects being measured. Rather,\r\nwe attempt to describe how to put measurement on a firm, well-defined foun-\r\ndation’. To put measurement in the social sciences on a firm foundation, axioms\r\nabout individual judgments, preferences and reactions need to be developed — the\r\nso-called representational problem.

Severity takes the pre-data error probabilities as determining the\r\ngeneric capacity of the test procedure, and custom-tailors that to the particular\r\ncase of data x0 and the relevant inferential claim H, rendering the post-data\r\nevaluation test-specific, data-specific and claim-specific. Thus, from the thesis of\r\nlearning from error, it follows that a severity assessment allows one to determine\r\nwhether there is evidence for (or against) H; see [Mayo, 1996].\r\nEXAMPLE 6. In the case of the simple Normal model (table 2), let the hypotheses\r\nof interest be:\r\nH0: µ = µ0 vs. H1: µ > µ0.

Depending on whether this test has given rise to\r\naccept or reject H0 with data x0, the post-data evaluation of that inference takes\r\nthe form of:\r\nSev(Tα;x0;µ ≤ µ1)= P(τ(X) > τ(x0);µ > µ1),\r\nSev(Tα;x0;µ > µ1)= P(τ(X) ≤ τ(x0);µ ≤ µ1),\r\n(28)\r\nrespectively, where µ1=µ0+γ, for γ ≥ 0. Severity introduces a discrepancy param-\r\neter γ ≥ 0 in order to evaluate the relevant inferential claims associated when\r\nH0 is accepted (µ ≤ µ1) or rejected (µ > µ1). This amounts to establishing the\r\nsmallest (largest) discrepancy γ ≥ 0 from H0 warranted by data x0, associated\r\nwith the N-P decision to accept (reject) H0. When the severity evaluation of a\r\nparticular inferential claim, say µ ≤ µ0+γ, is very high (close to one), it can be\r\ninterpreted as indicating that this claim is warranted to the extent that the test\r\nhas ruled out discrepancies larger than γ; the underlying test would have detected\r\na departure from the null as large as γ almost surely, and the fact that it didn’t\r\nsuggests that no such departures were present. This evaluation can be applied to\r\nthe result of any (properly defined) N-P test to address the fallacies of acceptance\r\nand rejection; see [Mayo and Spanos, 2006].\r\n","uuid":"5a2b329c-fe90-4900-b250-d18c64cc1806"},"_type":"pdf","highlight":{"text":["of inference using the notion of severity.\r\n5.7.1 Severity reasoning\r\nA hypothesis H passes a severe <em>test</em>","T with data x0 if,\r\n(S-1) x0 agrees with H, and\r\n(S-2) with very high probability, <em>test</em> T would have","Severity takes the pre-data error probabilities as determining the\r\ngeneric capacity of the <em>test</em> procedure","H1: µ > µ0.

In LSA,\r\nhowever, such forms exist in terms of the higher-order frequencies.\r\nThe use of manifest higher-order frequencies^, p^^ and so on, makes\r\nfor the much greater flexibility of the latent structure model. In\r\nstep 5 of section III we have seen how the higher-order frequencies\r\npermit the computation of the latent moments. The coefficients of the\r\nlinear trace lines, however, could be computed by going up only to\r\nsecond-order frequencies. In models with nonlinear trace lines the\r\nhigher-order frequencies are also needed to compute the trace line\r\ncoefficients. In a rather crude generalization one can say that the num-\r\nber of coefficients in the trace lines determines the level of manifest\r\njoint frequencies which enter the accounting equations.\r\nComparison with test theory. The full use of manifest data also\r\ncharacterizes the difference between LSA and test theory. A test score\r\nis a combination of a number of response patterns. All the people who\r\ngive an affirmative answer to say three out of ten items have the same\r\nscore. In LSA a distinction is made between the proportion of people\r\nwho give a positive response to any specific combination of three items\r\nout of ten. In a test of n items, test theory uses only n + 1 manifest\r\nfrequencies while actually 2n are available. The notion of a response-\r\npattern score was explained in section III, step 9: it is the expected\r\nposition on the latent continuum of a person who gives a certain re-\r\nsponse pattern. The test score, on the other hand, is the number of\r\nitems to which this person gives an affirmative reply. Interestingly\r\nenough, a mathematical relation can be established between the\r\nlatent continuum and the test score. For a test score is a manifest\r\ndatum which has its own trace line. To show this important fact we\r\nshall assume a test ofjust two items and use the data of Fig. 6 pertain-\r\ning to items 4 and 6.\r\nAt a given point of the latent continuum the probability of two,\r\none, or no affirmative answer is by simple probability considerations,\r\nrespectively:\r\n?<>(*)\r\n=\r\nThe values of these functions can correctly be called the latent scores.\r\nIntegrals of the form (l/pg)Jsg (x)x(p(x) dx give their expected values.\r\nThis is nothing else than the scoring procedure developed in steps 8\r\nand 9, section III, extended to groups of response patterns which have\r\nthe same number of affirmative answers.

It is also known as the Porsolt test or behavioural despair test (Cryan &\r\nHolmes 2005). Initially, it was assumed to model the acute trauma that might herald the\r\nonset of human depression. When the mouse gave up struggling in the water it was\r\nregarded as a sign of despair. The depressed mouse was seen to maintain behaviours\r\nthat expressed forms of captivation towards safety and security, but this response is\r\ninterrupted. Even if depression was not best understood as an interruption of captivation,\r\nthis was how it was modelled in the laboratory mouse.\r\nWith the documentation of complex, overlapping and chronic symptoms in clinical\r\ndepression this interpretation has changed (Craddock & Forty 2006; LaPorte et al 2008).\r\nScientists now acknowledge these tests are limited analogues of human behaviour (Abbot\r\n2007; Cryan & Holmes 2005).

An­\r\nother reason, crucial for the microeconomic approach, is that “so long as \r\nwe stick to the economic theory of index numbers, the circular test is as \r\nrequired as is the property of transitivity itself9 (Samuelson and Swamy \r\n1974, 576).

Introduction\r\nThis is the story of the Turing Test: a modest attempt to summarize its 50 years of\r\nexistence.\r\nThe British mathematician Alan Turing1 proposed the Turing Test (TT) as a\r\nreplacement for the question \"Can machines think?\" in his 1950 Mind article ‘Com-\r\nputing Machinery and Intelligence’ (Turing, 1950). Since then, Turing’s ideas have\r\nbeen widely discussed, attacked, and defended over and over. At one extreme,\r\nTuring’s paper has been considered to represent the \"beginning\" of artificial in-\r\ntelligence (AI) and the TT has been considered its ultimate goal. At the other\r\nextreme, the TT has been called useless, even harmful. In between are arguments\r\non consciousness, behaviorism, the ‘other minds’ problem, operational definitions\r\nof intelligence, necessary and sufficient conditions for intelligence-granting, and\r\nso on.\r\nThe aim of this paper is to present an overview of the debate that followed\r\nTuring’s paper, as well as the developments that have taken place in the past 50\r\nyears. We have tried to make this survey as comprehensive and multi-disciplinary\r\nas possible. Familiarity with special terms and concepts is not assumed.

The input code\r\nfor PIB is sorted by the net interpreter. Assume that Test 1 sorts it down\r\nthe plus branch of Fig. 3. As there are differences between the incumbent\r\nimage (with first letter D) and the new code (with first letter P) an\r\nattempt to store an image of PIB at this terminal would destroy the in-\r\nformation previously stored there.\r\nClearly what is needed is the ability to discriminate further.

In general, with little additional\r\neffort,\r\nmore than one difference can\r\nbe detected, and more than one discriminating test can be added to the net. Each\r\nredundant test placed in the net gives one \"empty\" image list. At some future time,\r\n'f an item is sorted to this empty image list, an image can be storedwithout growing\r\nthe net.

Some have suggested that AI’s ‘ultimate test’ is really mahjong!45\r\nMedia reports also claimed that AlphaGo was distinctly diferent from previous programs. \r\nYet Turing himself investigated artiicial neural networks (see Chapter 29) and wanted to build a \r\nmachine that could learn autonomously from experience (see Chapter 30). Anthony Oettinger, \r\nwho wrote the irst AI programs to include learning, was much inluenced by Turing’s views \r\non machine learning.46 Oettinger’s programs were written for the EDSAC computer at the \r\nUniversity of Cambridge, the second electronic stored-program computer to run, in May 1949. \r\nIn 2016 an editorial in he Times claiming that DeepMind’s computer was ‘not programmed \r\nhow to play’ Go but rather ‘taught itself ’ (and that it can ‘use intuition’ and ‘think’) drew a swit \r\nreaction from a scientist who had actually worked on the EDSAC.47 Norman Sanders said that \r\nDeepMind’s computer ‘did not learn to teach itself; it was programmed to do so’. here is ‘no dif-\r\nference in principle’, he claimed, between DeepMind’s machine and the EDSAC; the diference \r\nis ‘just that today’s processing capacity matches the requirements’ of chess and Go.48\r\nOettinger said that one of his programs could pass a restricted Turing test.49 Likewise, \r\naccording to one of the IBM scientists working on Watson, ‘if in the Turing test you were asking \r\npeople Jeopardy! questions and we couldn’t tell who was who, then we’ve actually passed the \r\nTuring test’.50 If a machine succeeded, though, in an unrestricted Turing test—played several \r\ntimes, with impeccable interrogators—would this suice to show that the machine can think? \r\nNo, say many opponents of Turing’s test: machines that do well in a full-scale imitation game \r\nmay nevertheless lack some element crucial for thought.\r\nThe X factor\r\nFor most critics, this essential element is consciousness. Ken Jennings, one of the losing human \r\ncontestants in the Jeopardy! match, said that he felt ‘obsolete’—‘it was friggin’ demoralizing. It \r\nwas terrible’. On Searle’s view, if Watson had lost, the computer would not have felt obsolete, \r\nor indeed felt anything; ‘in order to get human intelligence, you’ve got to be conscious’, Searle \r\nsays. Some AI sceptics say that AlphaGo didn’t even win the match against Lee; a computer can’t \r\n‘win’ at anything, it was claimed—not until it ‘can experience real joy in victory and sadness in \r\ndefeat’.51 his is, the critics say, why succeeding in the Turing test is not a criterion for thinking. \r\nhe imitation game can’t test for consciousness.\r\nIn the 1950s several theorists claimed that machines cannot be conscious. his is not to deny \r\nthat a machine can have what Donald Michie, another Bletchley Park colleague of Turing’s, \r\ncalled ‘operational awareness’—the ability to register inner states. What the machine cannot do, \r\nit was said, is experience the ‘feel’ of a taste, colour, or emotion; according to Geofrey Jeferson, \r\nfor example, no machine could feel grief ‘when its valves fuse’.52 One reply to this is that we can \r\nimagine a machine answering questions on grief (or other emotions, or tastes or colours) in a \r\nway indistinguishable from a human being—and how could it do so without having felt grief? \r\nOn this view, it may not be possible for a machine to succeed in Turing’s game without being \r\nconscious. But if it does succeed, that’s evidence it is conscious!\r\nYet, some have countered, we can also imagine a being—a philosophical ‘zombie’, a non-\r\nconscious being otherwise indistinguishable from a human—that does exactly this. he zom-\r\nbie example is intended to show that passing the Turing test is not a criterion for thinking, but \r\neven this objection is not the last word on the test.

In many of their \r\nexperiments, the basic conditions were (1) \r\nthe administration of a 25-item free associa¬ \r\ntion test (training list) and (2) the administra¬ \r\ntion of a second, similar test (test list). Be¬ \r\ntween these two test administrations a variety \r\nof training procedures was employed. The \r\ninterest of these investigators has been con¬ \r\ncerned with the effect of this training on the \r\noriginality of responses to the second test. \r\n(Originality here is defined as the mean fre¬ \r\nquency of the responses given by each sub¬ \r\nject, the frequencies being based on norma¬ \r\ntive data for the lists.) \r\nIn one experiment (Maltzman et al., 1960), \r\ntwo control groups were used. One simply \r\ntook the training and test lists in sequence. \r\nThe second took the training list and then \r\nretook it five times, each time attempting to \r\nrepeat the response to a given stimulus that \r\neach member of the group had made before. \r\nThen the test list was administered. Two ex¬ \r\nperimental groups responded associatively to \r\n125 new words between the training list and \r\nthe test list, one set of new words being of \r\nhigh and the other of low frequency. Finally, \r\na third experimental group took the training \r\ntest and then retook it five times, each time \r\nattempting to give a different response to \r\neach stimulus. Then it took the test list. \r\nThe scores of the two control groups \r\nshowed an increase in originality on the test \r\nlist, relative to the training list.5 However, the \r\nthree experimental groups showed much \r\nlarger increases in originality on the test list. \r\nComparable results have been reported by \r\nthese investigators for the training condition \r\nin which the training list is repeated several \r\ntimes with the subject attempting to give a \r\nnew response each time, although various \r\n5Maltzman & Simon (1959) found this effect to be a func¬ \r\ntion of time between testings. \r\nother training procedures were not success¬ \r\nful. Callup (1963, Experiment 3) has not rep¬ \r\nlicated these findings, and the reasons for the \r\nfailure are not at all clear (Maltzman & Gallup, \r\n1964). \r\nMaltzman and his coworkers (1958, 1960) \r\nhave also analyzed the changes in the number \r\nof idiosyncratic or unique responses given to \r\nthe stimuli of the training list when it is re¬ \r\npeated five times (after the initial testing) \r\nunder the instructions to give a different re¬ \r\nsponse each time to each stimulus. The per¬ \r\ncentage of unique responses changes from \r\nabout 10 on the first testing to about 70 on \r\nthe sixth testing (Maltzman et al., 1960, Fig¬ \r\nure 1, p. 4), a result confirmed by Caron, \r\nUnger, and Parloff (1962-1963). \r\nOn the basis of the information available, \r\nit is not possible to compare the findings \r\nreported by Wells (1911) with those reported \r\nby Maltzman, for Wells's characterization of \r\nchanges in the kinds of responses arising from \r\npractice did not include the measurement of \r\noriginality. Nevertheless, it is clear, from these \r\nstudies, that successive presentations of the \r\nsame or different lists alter the characteristics \r\nof responses found on a second list and on \r\nthe same list when it is repeated. \r\nIn the study already mentioned, Maltzman \r\nand his coworkers (1958) included a condition \r\nin which after responding to the training list \r\nthe first time, and, where appropriate, during \r\nthe repetitions of this list, students were \r\nasked to respond to the test list by being \"as \r\noriginal as possible on the new list of words.\" \r\nAgain, scoring the responses on the basis of \r\nthe norms for frequency, Maltzman and his \r\ncoworkers found a mean of 7.61 for the con¬ \r\ntrol subjects given instruction and one of \r\n23.98 for subjects that had not been given \r\ninstruction (the lower the value the more \r\noriginal the responses); similar differences \r\nwere found for the two experimental groups \r\nthat had responded with different responses \r\nto each of the five presentations of the \r\ntraining list. Clearly, these instructions had a \r\npowerful effect on the originality of associa¬ \r\ntions.
