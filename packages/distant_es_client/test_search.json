For \r\nexample, if one were to state that a specific IQ test “gets at” the referent of the con-\r\ncept of intelligence, it is legitimate to demand evidence that the test really does \r\nget at that referent. Whereas if intelligence is defined in terms of an IQ test, there \r\nis no epistemic gap between the referent of the concept of intelligence and the IQ \r\ntest—the referent of the concept of intelligence is nothing more than responses to an \r\nIQ test. Local operationalism allows safe passage from test results to claims about \r\nthe target concept by defining away the gap that separates them in methodological \r\noperationalism.\r\n2.2  Local operationalism in the wild\r\nPracticing research psychologists rarely take any explicit stance on operationalism. \r\nRather, they routinely engage in the act of operationalization, which is described in \r\nmany textbooks of psychological measurement. In their textbook, Evans and Rooney \r\n(2011) describe operationalization as an activity that turns a conceptual hypothesis \r\ninto a research hypothesis. A conceptual hypothesis is an intangible claim such as \r\n“Outgoing people have higher well-being than people who keep to themselves” and \r\na research hypothesis is a claim about test outcomes such as “People who score high \r\non standard test E of extraversion give higher ratings of well-being on test W than \r\ndo people who score low on E.” Here “ratings on test T” is an operational concep-\r\ntion of well-being, because it defines well-being in terms of a test, which is a type of \r\nscientific operation.\r\nThe fact that a researcher operationalizes happiness in terms of a rating on test \r\nH does not imply that the researcher believes there is nothing more to happiness \r\nthan the way people respond to test W. One common, epistemically innocent way \r\nto make sense of the act of operationalization is this: the operational concept of \r\nwell-being gets linked back to the “true” concept of well-being when researchers \r\nvalidate test W. For instance, if the true concept of well-being is “frequent positive \r\naffect and infrequent negative affect”, then the researcher needs to ensure that test W \r\ntracks this concept by validating the test. Understood in this way, operationalization \r\namounts to making the intended, non-operational target concept measurable, rather \r\nthan reducing the concept of interest to a more superficial, test-specific concept.\r\nNow, it is true that psychologists routinely validate their measures: they check corre-\r\nlations between the proposed test and tests of related concepts, study relations between \r\ndifferent items (i.e. questions) within the test, and perform factor analysis or an item \r\nresponse theoretic analysis to model the structure of responses to the measure (for an \r\noverview of these methods, see Markus & Borsboom, 2013; Nunnally & Bernstein, \r\n1994).4 But does this guarantee that the measure tracks the intended, non-operation-\r\nally-defined target concept? Many psychometricians, methodologists and philoso-\r\nphers of science have argued that the typical methods of validation in psychology are \r\nsimply insufficient to establish that a psychological test tracks the concept of interest \r\n4 I shall use the term validation in this broad sense throughout the paper.\r\n","uuid":"9aa345e0-c658-4f21-9176-575dda42461c"},"_type":"pdf","highlight":{"text":["For \r\nexample, if one were to state that a specific IQ <em>test</em> “gets at” the referent of the con-\r\ncept","more than responses to an \r\nIQ <em>test</em>.","well-being on <em>test</em> W than \r\ndo people who score low on E.”","in terms of a <em>test</em>, which is a type of \r\nscientific operation.","W \r\ntracks this concept by validating the <em>test</em>."]}},{"_id":"zZmMMoIB__mz3Yx-i5u1","_index":"distant_rl_history","_score":28.117085,"_source":{"citeKey":"MakHandbook12","created":1371120597000,"fileName":"[R] [[MakHandbook12]] MakiU - 2012 - Handbook of philosophy of economics.pdf","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[MakHandbook12]] MakiU - 2012 - Handbook of philosophy of economics.pdf","modified":1656713710000,"pageIndex":422,"pages":926,"text":"400 Marcel Boumans\r\nsatisfying combinations of these tests. As a result, Frisch arrives at the unique\r\nindex formula satisfying the circular test (4), commensurability test (5) and the\r\nfactor reversal test (7). However, Frisch also shows that the base test (3) (or\r\ncircular test (4)), the commensurability test (5) and the determinateness test (6)\r\ncan not all be fulfilled at the same time — they are incompatible. So, one has to\r\nchoose between the tests, which lead to a long discussion in the index literature\r\non the economic meaning and significance of each of them.\r\nAn important consideration for maintaining the circular test is that, when this\r\ncondition is met, an index number is freed from one base year. Another reason,\r\ncrucial to a microeconomic approach, is that the circular test is considered as the\r\nproperty of transitivity, which is essential for any index based on choice theory,\r\nsee former section.\r\nEichhorn’s axiomatic approach is an application of the axiomatic method as\r\npracticed in mathematical logic and is based on Tarski’s model theory. For an\r\naxiomatic system Σ, one of the most fundamental questions to analyze is whether\r\nΣ is consistent. Finding an interpretation of Σ can prove its consistency. An\r\ninterpretation of Σ is an assignment of meanings to the undefined terms of Σ in\r\nsuch a way that the axioms become simultaneously true statements for all values\r\nof the variables. Such interpretation is also called a model of Σ. When the axioms\r\nare formalized as functional equations, inconsistency theorems can then be proven\r\nby showing that for the relevant combinations of functional equations, the solution\r\nspace is empty.\r\nTo analyze an axiomatic system, another crucial question is whether its axioms\r\nare independent. Let A denote one of the axioms of Σ, and the denial of A by\r\n∼A, and let Σ−A denote system Σ with A deleted. If S is any statement phrased\r\nin terms of Σ, let Σ + S mean the axiom system containing the axioms of Σ and\r\nthe statement S as a new axiom. Then, A is called independent in Σ, or an\r\nindependent axiom of Σ, if both Σ and the axiom system (Σ− A)+ ∼ A have an\r\ninterpretation.\r\nThe power of this approach was immediately demonstrated in Eichhorn [1973].\r\nThe paper discusses five of Fisher’s tests:\r\n1. Proportionality test: P (ps, xs, λps, xt) = λ\r\n2. Circular test\r\n3. Commensurability test\r\n4. Determinateness test\r\n5.

In the ‘Turing litigation game’, an interrogator interviews two hidden con-\r\ntestants, one the plaintif and the other the defendant, with the aim of inding out whether the \r\ndefendant is guilty; proponents of this test say that it is cheaper and less cumbersome than cur-\r\nrent legal procedure. It is also oten assumed that the ictional Voigt–Kampf empathy test for \r\nandroids—from the story ‘Do androids dream of electric sheep?’ and the ilm Blade Runner—is \r\nbased on the Turing test. he test also appears in numerous cartoons (including several Dilbert \r\ncartoons), artworks (including ‘he original automatic confession machine: a Catholic Turing \r\nTest’), novels, and short stories—and on tee-shirts and baseball caps (Fig. 27.2).\r\nOne Turing-style test is now widespread. In a CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public \r\nTuring Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart) the judge is a computer whose task is to \r\ntell whether a single contestant is a human or a computer. (CAPTCHAs are sometimes called \r\n‘reverse’ Turing tests.) When you must identify a number in a distorted image before you can \r\nenter a chat room, vote, or use a credit card online, you are a contestant in a CAPTCHA.\r\nBashing the test\r\nSeveral commentators have argued that Turing did not intend his imitation game as a test of \r\nintelligence, and that he would have been amused, even horriied, at the game’s central role in \r\nAI. Marvin Minsky said recently that the Turing test is a ‘joke’ and that Turing ‘never intended \r\nit as the way to decide whether a machine was really intelligent’. Aaron Sloman claims that \r\nTuring was ‘far too intelligent to do any such thing’ and that this widespread misinterpretation \r\nhas led to ‘huge amounts of wasted efort’ discussing the purely ‘mythical’ Turing test. Likewise, \r\naccording to Drew McDermott, all that Turing wanted to do was to ‘shake people’s intuitions \r\nup’.25 Turing’s own words concerning what he called his ‘imitation tests’ make it clear, however, \r\nthat he did intend the game as a test of intelligence. He said ‘I would like to suggest a particular \r\nkind of test that one might apply to a machine’ and he described the question ‘Are there imagin-\r\nable digital computers which would do well in the imitation game?’ as a ‘variant’ of the question \r\n‘Can machines think?’. He certainly seemed to be serious, remarking ‘Well, that’s my test. Of \r\ncourse I am not saying at present either that machines really could pass the test, or that they \r\ncouldn’t. My suggestion is just that this is the question we should discuss’.26\r\nhe Turing test has had a hard ride, and—even though criticisms of the test reduce to a \r\nhandful of unsuccessful arguments—this will probably continue. Critics have described the \r\nTuring test as ‘virtually useless’, ‘obsolete’, and ‘impotent’, and machines that do well in the game \r\nas ‘dead ends in artiicial intelligence research’. Some say that ‘[a]dherence to Turing’s vision . . . \r\nis . . . actively harmful’ and that ‘Turing’s legacy alienates maturing subields’. In the avalanche \r\nof papers celebrating Turing’s centenary in 2012, the same objections appear; critics claim that \r\nthe time has come to ‘bid farewell to the Turing Test’.27\r\nSome of this criticism stems from the fact that the test is a criterion of human-level (or \r\nhuman-like) intelligence in machines. Critics claim that trying to build artiicial intelligence \r\nby imitating human beings is to ignore the essence of intelligence in favour of an emphasis on \r\none parochial example. On this view, the Turing test focuses AI research on uniquely human \r\nbehaviour and so is ‘a tragedy for AI’; the game is ‘testing humanity, not intelligence’.28 What \r\nwe need instead, critics say, is a test of ‘general’ or ‘universal’ intelligence (such as the ‘any-\r\ntime intelligence test’). However, this criticism of Turing is unfounded: the book you are now \r\n","uuid":"d9b28e34-d0e2-4303-9dac-d02f6ba291e9"},"_type":"pdf","highlight":{"text":["294  |  27 THE TURING <em>TEST</em>— fROm EVERy ANGlE\r\ntheir own: those who deceive the interviewers into thinking","and the ilm Blade Runner—is \r\nbased on the Turing <em>test</em>. he <em>test</em> also appears in numerous cartoons (including","One Turing-style <em>test</em> is now widespread.","He certainly seemed to be serious, remarking ‘Well, that’s my <em>test</em>.","of ‘general’ or ‘universal’ intelligence (such as the ‘any-\r\ntime intelligence <em>test</em>’)."]}},{"_id":"HpqVMoIB__mz3Yx-AesQ","_index":"distant_rl_history","_score":28.03437,"_source":{"citeKey":"CBSWTuring17","created":1492304709000,"fileName":"[R] [[CBSWTuring17]] CopelandJ et al - 2017 - The Turing Guide.pdf","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[CBSWTuring17]] CopelandJ et al - 2017 - The Turing Guide.pdf","modified":1658639098000,"pageIndex":291,"pages":565,"text":"COPElAND  |  273\r\n‘at least 100 years’ before a computer passed his test. Shah and Warwick’s mistaken claim that \r\nEugene Goostman passed the Turing test rests on their having conlated Turing’s 30% predic-\r\ntion with a speciication of what counts as passing the test. hey simply ignored Turing’s own \r\ncareful speciication, in terms of the man imitates woman game, of what would actually count \r\nas passing the test.\r\nIt is interesting to see Turing’s prediction about the extent of progress by the turn of the cen-\r\ntury coming true—and we can surely forgive him for being just a few years out. But, as Turing \r\nthought, his test may not be cracked for many years yet.\r\nmisunderstanding the Turing test\r\nAnother important misunderstanding about what Turing said concerns deinitions. He is \r\nrepeatedly described in the (now gigantic) literature about the Turing test as having intended \r\nhis test to form a deinition of thinking.41 However, the test does not provide a satisfactory def-\r\ninition of thinking, and so this misunderstanding of Turing’s views lays him open to spurious \r\nobjections, along the lines of ‘Turing attempted to deine thinking but his deinition does not \r\nwork’. Turing did make it completely clear though that his intention was not to deine thinking, \r\nsaying ‘I don’t really see that we need to agree on a deinition at all’,42 but his words were not \r\nheeded. ‘I don’t want to give a deinition of thinking’, he said, ‘but if I had to I should probably \r\nbe unable to say anything more about it than that it was a sort of buzzing that went on inside \r\nmy head’.43\r\nSomeone who takes the Turing test to be intended as a deinition of thinking will ind it \r\neasy to object to the deinition, since an entity that thinks could fail the test. For example, a \r\nthinking alien might fail simply because its responses are distinctively non-human. However, \r\nsince Turing did not intend his test as a deinition, this objection misses the point. Like many \r\nperfectly good tests, the Turing test is informative if the candidate passes but uninformative if \r\nthe candidate fails. If you fail an academic exam it might be because you didn’t know the mate-\r\nrial, or because you had terrible lu on the day of the exam, or for some other reason—but if you \r\npass fair and square, then you have unquestionably demonstrated that you know the material. \r\nSimilarly, if a computer passes the Turing test then the computer arguably thinks, but if it fails \r\nnothing can be concluded.\r\nOne currently inluential criticism of the Turing test is based on this mistaken idea that \r\nTuring intended his test as a deinition of thinking. he criticism is this: a gigantic database \r\nstoring every conceivable (inite) English conversation could, in principle, pass the Turing test \r\n(assuming the test is held in English).44 Whatever the judge says to the database, the database’s \r\noperating system just searches for the appropriate stored conversation and regurgitates the \r\ncanned reply to what the judge has said. As the philosopher Ned Block has put it, this database \r\nno more thinks than a jukebox does, yet in principle it would succeed in passing the Turing \r\ntest. Block agrees that this hypothetical database is in fact ‘too vast to exist’—it simply could \r\nnot be built and operated in the real world, since the total number of possible conversations is \r\nastronomical—but he maintains that, nevertheless, this hypothetical counter-example proves \r\nthe Turing test to be faulty.45\r\nIt is true that the database example would be a problem if the Turing test were supposed to \r\nbe a deinition of thinking, since the deinition would entail that this monster database thinks, \r\nwhen obviously it does not. But the test is not supposed to be a deinition, and the database \r\n","uuid":"45e7d9f4-e01a-43fd-94f1-72284e38f8c8"},"_type":"pdf","highlight":{"text":["COPElAND  |  273\r\n‘at least 100 years’ before a computer passed his <em>test</em>.","But, as Turing \r\nthought, his <em>test</em> may not be cracked for many years yet.","his <em>test</em> to form a deinition of thinking.41 However, the <em>test</em> does not provide a satisfactory def-","(inite) English conversation could, in principle, pass the Turing <em>test</em> \r\n(assuming the <em>test</em> is held","But the <em>test</em> is not supposed to be a deinition, and the database"]}}],"max_score":28.892342,"total":{"relation":"eq","value":9809}},"timed_out":false,"took":10}
